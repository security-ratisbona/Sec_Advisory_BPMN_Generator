# Sec_Advisory_BPMN_Generator
This is the official repository of our research paper "Generating semi-automated security playbooks for vulnerability mitigation from unstructured advisory data". 
It includes the full code of the developed prototypical implementation of the architecture. It also includes the full set of generated playbooks, generated within the JSON meta-model.

## Structure of the Repository
1. Playbook Generator 
2. BPMN_Parser 
3. Datasets
4. BPMN_Playbooks
5. Meta_Playbooks


### 1. Playbook Generator
The code of our orchestration Prototype, enriched with additional files, e.g. generated error codes as csv.

### 2. BPMN Parser
The python-based prototype, that transforms the meta-playbooks into a bpmn-file, which can be visualized within a BPMN tool, e.g. Camunda Modeler.

### 3. Datasets
csv files of the playbook steps classified into OpenC2 actions, within the second LLM Layer

### 4. BPMN Playbooks
Demonstrating set of playbooks transformed from the meta-model into a bpmn file, and visualized in Camunda (Jpeg)

### 5. Meta Playbooks
The full dataset of 725 Playbooks, in the meta-model format, generated by the first Layer
