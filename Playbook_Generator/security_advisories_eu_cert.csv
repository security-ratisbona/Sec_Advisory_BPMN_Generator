Patching seems to be going without problems for Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2012. However, for Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2022 and Windows 10/11, there are some issues that have been reported: - The Hyper-V service no longer starts so it is no longer possible to launch the virtual machines. - Domain controllers restart in loop. - Issues with VPN connectivity on Windows client Based on these issues, five patches have been identified as troublesome: - Windows Server 2012 R2: KB5009624 - Windows Server 2019: KB5009557 - Windows Server 2022: KB5009555 - Windows 10: KB5009543 - Windows 11: KB5009566 In order to fix these issues, Microsoft released a second set of patches called: **emergency out-of-band (OOB) updates**: >_This update addresses issues related to VPN connectivity, Windows Server Domain Controllers restarting, Virtual Machines start failures, and ReFS-formatted removable media failing to mount._ All OOB updates released are available for download on the Microsoft Update Catalog, and some of them can also be installed directly through Windows Update as optional updates. If you want to install the emergency fixes through Windows Update, you will have to manually check for updates because they are optional updates and will not install automatically. If you cannot immediately install today's out-of-band updates, you can still remove the KB5009624, KB5009557, KB5009555, KB5009566, and KB5009543 updates causing these issues. For that, admins can do a rollback or can issue one of the following commands: - Windows Server 2012 R2: `wusa /uninstall /kb:KB5009624` - Windows Server 2019: `wusa /uninstall /kb:KB5009557` - Windows Server 2022: `wusa /uninstall /kb:KB5009555` - Windows 10: `wusa /uninstall /kb:5009543` - Windows 11: `wusa /uninstall /kb:5009566` **Exception:** On Microsoft Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 (version 1809), a mitigation is possible for the `CVE-2022-21907` without applying patches: - Delete the `DWORD` registry value `EnableTrailerSupport` if present under: ``` HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\HTTP\Parameters ``` This mitigation only applies to Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10, version 1809 and does not apply to the Windows 20H2 and newer. Regarding the other vulnerabilities, no issues has been reported so they can safely be applied. # References [1] <https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2022-21907> [2] <https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2022-21846> [3] <https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2022-21969> [4] <https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2022-21855> [5] <https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2022-21840> [6]	<https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2022-21841> [7] <https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2022-21842> [8] <https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2022-21837> [9] <https://securityonline.info/cve-2022-21907-http-protocol-stack-remote-code-execution-vulnerability/> [10] <https://github.com/antx-code/CVE-2022-21907>"

If both options are set to different settings than the default values, the system is not affected by the security issue. # Recommendations Samba team and CERT-EU strongly recommend upgrading Samba to the latest version as soon as possible. ## Workaround As a temporary workaround, one can remove the `fruit` VFS module from the list of configured VFS objects in any `vfs objects` line in the Samba configuration `smb.conf`. Note that changing the VFS module settings `fruit:metadata` or `fruit:resource` to use the unaffected setting causes all stored information to be inaccessible. # References [1] <https://www.samba.org/samba/history/security.html> [2] <https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2021-44142.html>"

Spring Boot 2.5.12 with Spring Framework 5.3.18 and 5.3.20 is also available [6]. It is strongly recommended to upgrade as soon as possible.  Regarding VMware products, the vendor has already made available security updates for the first two affected softwares but a permanent fix for VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition is still in the works [3, 8]. Furthermore, VMWare has published workaround instructions designed to help administrators mitigate the issue on their systems until the patches are released [9]. For the `CVE-2022-22963` vulnerability, CERT-EU strongly recommends to upgrade to 3.1.7+ or 3.2.3+ to mitigate this RCE. ## Mitigations If patching of `CVE-2022-22965` is not immediately possible, the recommended approach is to apply the workaround in a more fail-safe way - applications could extend `RequestMappingHandlerAdapter` to update the `WebDataBinder` at the end after all other initialisation [6]. Other (earlier) attempts at the mitigations are also described in [2, 4].

On May 13, CISA warned not to install May Windows update on domain controllers, because it might create authentication failures on the server or client for some services [8]. The patches for the two elevations privilege vulnerabilites in Windows Kerberos and Active Directory Domain Services, respectively tracked as CVE-2022-26931 and CVE-2022-26923, are responsible for this service authentication problems once deployed on Windows Server Domain Controlers [9]. However, CISA noted that the application of the updates released by Microsoft will not cause issues on Windows client and non-domain controller server [8]. According to Microsoft, however, regarding Windows Server Domain Controlers, if the patch has been applied, Microsoft recommends to manually map the certificates to a machine account in Active Directory [10, 11]. This is needed until Microsoft issues an official update to address this services authentication problems caused by the security update. On May 19, Microsoft resolved the issue in out-of-band updates for installation on Domain Controllers. There is no action needed on the client side to resolve authentication issue of Domain Controllers. If you used any workaround or mitigation for this issue, they are no longer needed, and Microsoft recommends you to remove them [12].

Enabling `Protected View` and disabling `Preview Mode` is still recommended. ## Monitoring CERT-EU highly recommends monitoring for suspicious behaviours of Microsoft Office products: the process `msdt.exe` should not be spawned by Office products like `words.exe`, `outlook.exe` and also `excel.exe`. Some researchers have released monitoring rules for various products: - Sigma [6] - Sentinel [7] - Defender [8] ## Workarounds _Note: The workarounds described below are to be implemented if updating is not an option._ As a temporary workaround, Didier Stevens proposed to remove the `ms-msdt` handler in the registry hives. While this could prevent legitimate applications to work, it seems that there are not many applications using it [9]. Microsoft also provided this word around [13]. The same way as for the MSDT mitigation, it is possible to delete the `search-ms` protocol handler from the Windows Registry [15]. It is also possible to use the Attack Surface Reduction features to prevent Office applications from spawning child processes [10]. However, some legitimate line-of-business applications might also generate child processes for benign purposes and will be blocked if enabled. # References [1] <https://nao-sec.org/about> [2] <https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4a24048f81afbe9fb62e7a6a49adbd1faf41f266b5f9feecdceb567aec096784/detection> [3] <https://blog.syss.com/posts/abusing-ms-office-protos/> [4] <https://youtu.be/GybD70_rZDs> [5] <https://doublepulsar.com/follina-a-microsoft-office-code-execution-vulnerability-1a47fce5629e> [6] <https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/process_creation/proc_creation_win_msdt.yml> [7] <https://github.com/le0li9ht/Microsoft-Sentinel-Queries/blob/main/Detect-Follina-Exploitation.kql> [8] <https://github.com/GossiTheDog/ThreatHunting/blob/master/AdvancedHuntingQueries/Follina-Office.ahq> [9] <https://twitter.com/sans_isc/status/1531075423270051841?s=20&t=_NYOie6ydEbP4JT5zHVJ7A> [10] <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference?view=o365-worldwide#block-all-office-applications-from-creating-child-processes> [11] <https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2022-30190> [12] <https://twitter.com/wdormann/status/1531427345143320576> [13] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-shares-mitigation-for-office-zero-day-exploited-in-attacks/> [14] <https://twitter.com/hackerfantastic/status/1531789430922567681> [15] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-windows-search-zero-day-added-to-microsoft-protocol-nightmare/> [16] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-patches-actively-exploited-follina-windows-zero-day/>"

Please find the link to the documentation at the bottom of the page [5]. ## [UPDATE] How To Look For Evidence of Information Disclosure Via Email In order to determine if Confluence has sent e-mail notifications to third party e-mails, Atlassian suggests to review the logs of the SMTP server configured to send outbound mail from Confluence [6] and identify any messages sent to the `dontdeletethisuser@email.com` address. # Affected Products The following products are affected by the vulnerability: - Questions for Confluence 2.7.x - versions 2.7.34, 2.7.35 - Questions for Confluence 3.0.2 - version 3.0.2 Please be aware that these are the versions of the app that create the `disabledsystemuser` user with a hardcoded password, however, Confluence installations that do not actively have any of these versions of the app installed may still be affected.  Refer to the [How to Determine if You Are Affected] section above for more information. # Recommendations The following two options have been provided to address the flaw: - **Update to a non-vulnerable version of Questions for Confluence:**     - For versions 2.7.x, update to 2.7.38 or higher.     - Version 3.0.5 or higher. - **Disable or delete the disabledsystemuser account.** Please note that uninstalling the _Questions for Confluence_ app does not remediate this vulnerability, as the `disabledsystemuser` account does not automatically get removed after the app has been uninstalled.  # References [1] <https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/questions-for-confluence-security-advisory-2022-07-20-1142446709.html> [2] <https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-groups-139478.html> [3] <https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/email-notifications-145162.html> [4] <https://twitter.com/fluepke/status/1549892089181257729> [5] <https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-get-a-list-of-users-with-their-last-logon-times-985499701.html> [6] <https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/configuring-a-server-for-outgoing-mail-151078.html>"

This configuration is not typical for URL filtering and is likely unintended by the administrator. This issue is applicable to PA-Series (hardware), VM-Series (virtual), and CN-Series (container) firewalls only when all three of the following conditions are true: - The security policy on the firewall that allows traffic to pass from Zone A to Zone B includes a URL filtering profile with one or more blocked categories; - Packet-based attack protection is not enabled in a Zone Protection profile for Zone A including both (Packet Based Attack Protection > TCP Drop > TCP Syn With Data) and (Packet Based Attack Protection > TCP Drop > Strip TCP Options > TCP Fast Open); - Flood protection through SYN cookies is not enabled in a Zone Protection profile for Zone A (Flood Protection > SYN > Action > SYN Cookie) with an activation threshold of 0 connections. # Recommendations CERT-EU strongly recommends applying the software updates as soon as they are available. While waiting for the software updates to be released, CERT-EU recommends applying the workarounds and mitigation listed below. ## Workarounds and Mitigation If a URL filtering policy with one or more blocked categories assigned to a security rule with a source zone that has an external facing interface is enabled, removing this configuration will prevent this issue from being exploited by remote attackers to conduct reflected DoS. Also, enabling one of two following zone protection mitigation on all Security zones with an assigned Security policy that includes a URL filtering profile will prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks resulting from this issue from all sources (it is not necessary nor advantageous to apply both the attack and flood protections): 1.  Packet-based attack protection including both (Packet Based Attack Protection > TCP Drop > TCP SYN with Data) and (Packet Based Attack Protection > TCP Drop > Strip TCP Options > TCP Fast Open) [2]; 2. Flood protection (Flood Protection > SYN > Action > SYN Cookie) with an activation threshold of 0 connections [3]. _Note: None of these protections should be enabled if using Aporeto software; instead, wait for and install a fixed version of PAN-OS software._ # References [1] <https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2022-0028> [2] <https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/zone-protection-and-dos-protection/configure-zone-protection-to-increase-network-security/configure-packet-based-attack-protection> [3] <https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/zone-protection-and-dos-protection/zone-defense/zone-protection-profiles/flood-protection>"

https://cow-prod-www-v3.azurewebsites.net/publications/security-advisories/2023-002/markdown,"## CVE-2022-41903 `git` uses gitattributes to define attributes for paths. Users can define these attributes by adding a `.gitattributes` file to the repository. This file contains a set of file patterns and the attributes that `git` should set for matching paths. Multiple integer overflows can occur when `git` parses a huge number of patterns, a huge number of attributes for a single pattern, or when the declared attribute names are huge. An attacker can trigger these overflows via a crafted `.gitattributes` file that may be part of the commit history. The failure depends on whether the file exists in the working tree, the index, or both. `git` splits lines longer than 2KB when parsing gitattributes from files but not when parsing them from the index.  In the latter case, the overflow can result in arbitrary heap reads and writes, which may result in remote code execution [6]. ## CVE-2022-41953 Git GUI is a graphical tool bundled with Git for Windows. After cloning a repository, Git GUI will automatically post-process it. This post-processing includes, if available, running a spell checker called `aspell.exe`. Unfortunately, due to the use of Tcl/Tk as a GUI framework, the path to search for an executable _will always include the current directory_. Therefore, Git GUI could execute a malicious `aspell.exe` in the top-level directory of a cloned repository without leaving the user a chance to inspect it first and run potentially untrusted code on the local system [7]. # Affected Products * git-for-windows     * affected versions: <=2.39.0(2)     * patched versions: >=2.39.1 * git     * affected versions:  <= v2.30.6, v2.31.5, v2.32.4, v2.33.5, v2.34.5, v2.35.5, v2.36.3, v2.37.4, v2.38.2, v2.39.0     * patched versions: >= v2.30.7, v2.31.6, v2.32.5, v2.33.6, v2.34.6, v2.35.6, v2.36.4, v2.37.5, v2.38.3, v2.39.1 * GitLab CE/EE     * affected versions: < 15.7.4, 15.6.5, 15.5.8     * patched versions: >= 15.7.5, 15.6.6, 15.5.9 * Github Enterprise Server     * affected versions: < 3.3.19, 3.4.14, 3.5.11, 3.6.7, 3.7.4     * patched versions: >= 3.3.19, 3.4.14, 3.5.11, 3.6.7, 3.7.4 # Recommendations CERT-EU very strongly recommends that all installations running an affected version are upgraded to the latest version as soon as possible.

For this purpose, Microsoft provides documentation and a PowerShell script [5]. The script will check tasks, e-mail messages, and calendar items for properties with UNC path directly on the Microsoft Exchange server (on premises and in the cloud). Organisations should review the output of this script to determine risk and act accordingly if any item is considered malicious.  Be aware that CERT-EU recommends running the script in **audit mode** and not using the cleanup mode directly. The cleanup mode will destroy forensic evidence, and, in the most severe cases, data loss may occur. ## Mitigations CERT-EU recommends firmly blocking TCP 445/SMB outbound from your network using a perimeter firewall, a local firewall, and your VPN settings. This approach will prevent sending NTLM authentication messages to remote file shares. This blocking rule should default in a perimeter firewall regardless of the current vulnerability. Additionally, CERT-EU recommends adding high-value accounts, such as Domain Admins, to the Protected Users Security Group. This approach prevents using NTLM as an authentication mechanism. Performing this mitigation makes troubleshooting easier than other methods of disabling NTLM. However, this will **cause an impact** on applications that require NTLM authentication. Removing the user from the Protected Users Security Group will revert the settings. Please see Protected Users Security Group [6] for more information. # References [1] <https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-23397> [2] <https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/microsoft-mitigates-outlook-elevation-of-privilege-vulnerability/> [3] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-fixes-outlook-zero-day-used-by-russian-hackers-since-april-2022/> [4] <https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/initial-access/netntlmv2-hash-stealing-using-outlook> [5] <https://microsoft.github.io/CSS-Exchange/Security/CVE-2023-23397/> [6] <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/credentials-protection-and-management/protected-users-security-group>"

In addition, you may block the inbound connections for `1801/tcp` from untrusted sources [3]. ## Detections To detect potential exploitation attempts, CERT-EU recommends reviewing network connections on endpoints where the Microsoft Message Queuing service is running (port `1801/tcp`) from unexpected sources, and then, reviewing the potential child processes of `mqsvc.exe` for suspicious events (e.g., `mqsvc.exe` executing `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe`, among other binaries). # References [1] <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/msmq/ms711472(v=vs.85)> [2] <https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-21554> [3] <https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/queuejumper-critical-unauthorized-rce-vulnerability-in-msmq-service/?__cf_chl_tk=7J8iZgI93c_ba6v1rOms3UyRgIV9ww0x57IqmNjMQsQ-1681463870-0-gaNycGzNDJA> [4] <https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/releaseNote/2023-Apr>"

https://cow-prod-www-v3.azurewebsites.net/publications/security-advisories/2023-033/markdown,"## Detection  An attacker can leverage the SQLi to clear the database of almost all IOC’s. However there is one entry in the database the attacker cannot clear. When performing the final SQLi to delete all IOCs from the database, a single log entry will remain. This log entry is generated after the SQLi is performed and as such cannot be deleted via SQLi. This log entry will have an Action of `msg_post` and will contain the IP address of the attacker in the `IPAddress` field and a timestamp in the `LogTime` field. The other fields may contain values the attacker used when performing the SQLi, such as the `MyGuestEmailAddr` value from the forged package used during SQLi. A strong IOC may be present in the log file `C:\MOVEitTransfer\Logs\DMZ_WebApi.log`. During deserialisation of the malicious gadget an exception of type `TargetInvocationException` will be thrown and the call stack will show the method:  ``` MOVEit.DMZ.Application.Folders.ResumableUploadFilePartHandler.DeserializeFileUploadStream ``` which is the method that contains the deserialisation vulnerability [5].  # Affected Products The affected product are: - MOVEit Transfer before 2023.0.0, 2022.1.x, 2022.0.x, 2021.1.x, 2021.0.x. # Recommendations To mitigate this vulnerability, upgrade MOVEit Transfer to 2023.0.1, 2022.1.5, 2022.0.4, 2021.1.4 and 2021.0.6. According to Progress’ mitigations [1], before applying the patches, the HTTP (TCP/80) and HTTPS (TCP/443) traffic should be denied to the MOVEit environment and activated after that. Also, any potential unauthorised files or user accounts should be cleaned from the system.  Note that this will block all access to the system, but SFTP/FTP will still work, which currently appears unaffected. # References [1] <https://community.progress.com/s/article/MOVEit-Transfer-Critical-Vulnerability-31May2023>  [2] <https://www.trustedsec.com/blog/critical-vulnerability-in-progress-moveit-transfer-technical-analysis-and-recommendations/> [3] <https://www.horizon3.ai/moveit-transfer-cve-2023-34362-deep-dive-and-indicators-of-compromise/> [4] <https://github.com/horizon3ai/CVE-2023-34362> [5] <https://attackerkb.com/topics/mXmV0YpC3W/cve-2023-34362/rapid7-analysis> [6] <https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2023/06/05/cve-2023-34362-exploited/> [7] <https://community.progress.com/s/article/MOVEit-Transfer-Critical-Vulnerability-CVE-2023-35036-June-9-2023>"

In addition, Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products [1]: - Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software; - FXOS Software; - IOS Software; - IOS XE Software; - IOS XR Software; - NX-OS Software. # Recommendations Cisco will release software updates that address this vulnerability. Until fixes are made available, please review and implement workarounds that address this vulnerability. ## Workarounds While there is no method to completely prevent a brute force attack attempt, you can implement the following recommendations to protect against unauthorised client-less SSL VPN session establishment using the `DefaultADMINGroup` or `DefaultL2LGroup` connection profiles/tunnel groups [1]: - configure a dynamic access policy (DAP) to terminate VPN tunnel establishment when the `DefaultADMINGroup` or `DefaultL2LGroup` connection profile/tunnel group is used; - deny remote access VPN using the default group policy (`DfltGrpPolicy`); - restrict users in the `LOCAL` user database - lock users to a specific connection profile/tunnel group only; - prevent users from establishing remote access VPN sessions. # References [1] <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-ravpn-auth-8LyfCkeC#fs> [2] <https://blogs.cisco.com/security/akira-ransomware-targeting-vpns-without-multi-factor-authentication>"

The following versions contain a fix for the HTTP/2 rapid reset attack: - Kong Gateway Enterprise: 2.8.4.4, 3.1.1.6, 3.2.2.5, 3.3.1.1, 3.4.1.1 - Kong Gateway OSS: 3.4.2 - Kong Mesh: 2.0.8, 2.1.7, 2.2.5, 2.3.3, 2.4.3 - Kuma: 2.0.8, 2.1.7, 2.2.5, 2.3.3, 2.4.3 # Unaffected Products Web applications protected by the following DDoS protection providers or Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) should not be impacted: - AWS [9] - Cloudflare [2] - Google Cloud [1] - Microsoft Azure [8] - HAProxy [10] # Detections ## Testing if HTTP/2 is enabled ### Openssl  `echo 1 | openssl s_client -alpn h2 -connect google.com:443 -status 2>&1  | grep ""ALPN""` ### Nmap `nmap -p 443 --script=tls-nextprotoneg <www.google.com>` # Recommendations **[UPDATE]** Apache, Microsoft (IIS and MsQuic), and Kong have issued patches for this vulnerability. It is strongly recommended applying it as soon as possible. If you are affected, it's recommended to: - Track connection statistics and identify abusive connections. - Close connections that exceed the concurrent stream limit, either immediately or after a small number of repeat offenses. - Implement forceful `GOAWAY` frames to limit stream creation immediately. - As a last resort, consider disabling HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 to mitigate the threat, although this may result in performance issues. On the longer terms, it is recommended to use DDoS protection mechanisms. ## Mitigations Since the vulnerability has been recently discovered, all vendors didn't provide advisories yet. This paper will be updated in the next days. ### Nginx Disabling HTTP/2 in NGINX is not necessary. Simply ensure you have configured the following elements : - `keepalive_requests` should be kept at the default setting of 1000 requests - `http2_max_concurrent_streams` should be kept at the default setting of 128 streams - `limit_conn` enforces a limit on the number of connections allowed from a single client. This directive should be added with a reasonable setting balancing application performance and security. - `limit_req` enforces a limit on the number of requests that will be processed within a given amount of time from a single client. This directive should be added with a reasonable setting balancing application performance and security. [4] Nginx plans to issue a patch that increases stability under these conditions. ### Microsoft IIS and MsQuic Microsoft published a security update as well as a workaround [7]. CERT-EU recommends using the workaround **only** if you're not able to install the latest updates. Furthermore, a patch for MsQuic product has been released. CERT-EU recommends updating the MsQuic servers as soon as possible. [12] ### Netscaler  Netscaler published recommendations to help reduce the load on backend servers behind Netscaler load balancing and content switching products. CERT-EU recommends carefully considering the impacts of the proposed workarounds before applying them.[11] ### General remediations Remove reference to `http2` in the listening part of the web server configuration file. # References [1] <https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/how-it-works-the-novel-http2-rapid-reset-ddos-attack?hl=en> [2] <https://blog.cloudflare.com/zero-day-rapid-reset-http2-record-breaking-ddos-attack/> [3] <https://tomcat.apache.org/security-8.html#Fixed_in_Apache_Tomcat_8.5.94> [4] <https://www.nginx.com/blog/http-2-rapid-reset-attack-impacting-f5-nginx-products/> [5] <https://www.f5.com/company/blog/http-2-rapid-reset-attack-impacting-f5-nginx-products> [6] <https://gist.github.com/adulau/7c2bfb8e9cdbe4b35a5e131c66a0c088> [7] <https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-44487> [8] <https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/10/microsoft-response-to-distributed-denial-of-service-ddos-attacks-against-http/2/> [9] <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-aws-protects-customers-from-ddos-events/> [10] <https://www.haproxy.com/blog/haproxy-is-not-affected-by-the-http-2-rapid-reset-attack-cve-2023-44487> [11] <https://www.netscaler.com/blog/news/how-to-mitigate-the-http-2-rapid-reset-vulnerability-on-netscaler/> [12] <https://github.com/microsoft/msquic/releases/tag/v2.2.3> [13] <https://konghq.com/blog/product-releases/novel-http2-rapid-reset-ddos-vulnerability-update>"
https://cow-prod-www-v3.azurewebsites.net/publications/security-advisories/2023-075/markdown,"# Remediation The Mandiant report [2] about the **CVE-2023-4966** contains the following remediation steps: 1. Isolate NetScaler ADC and Gateway Appliances     - Isolate the appliances for testing and preparation of patch deployment.     > Note: If the vulnerable appliances cannot be prioritised for patching, Mandiant recommends that the appliances have ingress IP address restrictions enforced to limit the exposure and attack surface until the necessary patches have been applied. 2. Upgrade Appliances     - Upgrade vulnerable NetScaler ADC and Gateway appliances to the latest firmware versions, which mitigate the vulnerability. 3. Terminate Sessions     - Post upgrading, terminate all active and persistent sessions (per appliance). 4.  CLI Connection and Command     - Connect to the NetScaler appliance using the CLI.     - Run the following command (where `<vServer>` is the name of the virtual server / appliance).         ```         kill icaconnection -all         kill rdp connection -all         kill pcoipConnection -all         kill aaa session -all         clear lb persistentSessions         ``` 5. Credential Rotation     - Due to the lack of available log records or other artefacts of exploitation activity, as a precaution, organisations should consider rotating credentials for identities that were provisioned for accessing resources via a vulnerable NetScaler ADC or Gateway appliance.     - If there is evidence of suspicious activity or lateral movement within an environment, organisations should prioritise credential rotation for a larger scope of identities if single factor authentication (SFA) remote access is allowed for any resources from the Internet. 6. Search for Web Shells or Backdoors     - If web shells or backdoors are identified on NetScaler appliances, Mandiant recommends rebuilding the appliances using a clean-source image, including the latest firmware.     > Note: If a restoration of an appliance is required using a backup image, the backup configuration should be reviewed to ensure that there is no evidence of backdoors. 7. Restrict Ingress Access     - If possible, reduce the external attack exposure and attack surface of NetScaler appliances by restricting ingress access to only trusted or predefined source IP address ranges. # Investigation Mandiant has not identified any available logs or other artefacts resident on NetScaler appliances that record evidence of exploitation. Scoping an investigation has consisted of: – Reviewing NetScaler appliances for evidence of backdoors or web shells. – Identifying suspicious logon events / lateral movement originating from published systems or resources accessible through the NetScaler appliances. – Correlating authentication and logon events (e.g., VDI systems published through NetScaler appliances) sourced from geographic locations that are not part of an established baseline. – Correlating authentication and logon events where a successful MFA challenge response was not logged. On October 25, 2023, AssetIO brought more details [3] about the exploitation of **CVE-2023-4966** giving opportunities to detect a possible exploitation of the vulnerability. However, this requires an HTTP frontend source (.e.g network probe, WAF or reverse proxy) before reaching the Citrix HTTP services. Check the HTTP logs reaching the URI `/oauth/idp/.well-known/openid-configuration` with a GET method with the status code 200. If hits are found, check if the HTTP response bytes are above `1000000` or if the strings `aaaaaaaaaa` are in the HTTP host header. **[UPDATE]** Mandiant has used the following approaches [5] to identify potential exploitation of **CVE-2023-4966** and subsequent session hijacking. These include the following techniques [5]: * Investigating requests to the vulnerable HTTP/S endpoint from WAF: Analysing the incoming requests in the web application firewall logs to identify any unusual or malicious requests targeting the vulnerability, see above. * Identifying suspicious login patterns based on NetScaler record syslog information in `/var/log/ns.log`:     * Suspicious SSLVPN sessions can be identified by comparing the IP addresses recorded in the `Client_ip` and the `Source` fields in `TCPCONNSTAT` events. `TCPCONNSTAT` events record TCP connection-related information for a connection belonging to an SSLVPN session.     * Identify source IP addresses that access multiple user accounts in a short period of time recorded in the `ns.log` files or forwarded logs via syslog. While a threat actor can choose only to access a single account from a single source IP address, Mandiant has observed that multiple accounts were accessed within hours from the same source IP address by a threat actor. * Identifying evidence of exploitation using memory analysis of NetScaler Memory Core Dump Files: In some cases, evidence of exploitation can be found in the memory space of the `NSPPE` process of the appliance. Exploitation of CVE-2023-4966 will not crash the `NSPPE` process and generate memory core dump files. To perform analysis of NetScaler memory core dump files, they need to be collected. It is important not to reboot the appliance prior to generating a core dump for analysis. **[UPDATE]** Following the successful exploitation of **CVE-2023-4966**, Mandiant observed the following TTPs: - Host and network reconnaissance. - Credential harvesting. - Lateral movement via RDP. - Active Directory reconnaissance using living-off-the-land binaries (e.g., `net.exe`). - Internal network enumeration using SoftPerfect network scanner (`netscan.exe`). - Compressing reconnaissance results using 7-zip and encoding segments with `certutil`. - Loading malicious DLLs into lsass process memory to create a memory dump for offline credential extraction. - Deployment of a newly tracked backdoor, `FREEFIRE`, which uses Slack for command and control. - Deployment of remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools like Atera, AnyDesk, and SplashTop to maintain a foothold post-exploitation. # Affected Products - NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 14.1 before 14.1-8.50 - NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 13.1 before 13.1-49.15 - NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 13.0 before 13.0-92.19 - NetScaler ADC 13.1-FIPS before 13.1-37.164 - NetScaler ADC 12.1-FIPS before 12.1-55.300 - NetScaler ADC 12.1-NDcPP before 12.1-55.300 Note: NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway version 12,1 is now End-of-Life (EOL) and is vulnerable [1]. # Recommendations CERT-EU recommends updating and remediating affected devices as soon as possible.

It is then advised to: - reset local users' password (including the one of the service accounts used for auth server configuration); - revoke and replace any private certificate that was installed on the ICS; - hunt for suspicious events during the past weeks (suspicious authentication, recently created privileged users, etc.) **[New]** As for the vulnerability **CVE-2024-22024**:  - If the process desbribed above (i.e., see immediate actions) has been performed, CERT-EU recommends applying the patches available as soon as possible [6]. - If the process desbribed above (i.e., see immediate actions) has not been performed, CERT-EU recommends applying the update as par of the remediation actions. ## Mitigation **[Updated]** The zero-days can be mitigated by importing the `importing mitigation.release.20240126.5.xml` file available to customers via Ivanti's download portal [2]. As the vulnerabilities affect critical functionality of the affected Ivanti systems, applying the mitigation file (rather than patching) can have serious adverse effects on their operation. This mitigation successfully blocks the vulnerability **CVE-2024-22024**. As per Ivanti, customers should stop pushing configurations to appliances having the mitigation in place until the appliance is patched [2]. If configurations are pushed while the mitigation is in place, it will stop the mitigation from functioning and leave the appliances vulnerable. As per Ivanti, the provided mitigation blocks the exploitation of vulnerabilities and prevents further use of the webshell. ## Compromise assessment Ivanti advises customers to run the external Integrity Checker Tool (ICT) [3]. However, the ICT will scan a snapshot of the current state of the appliance and cannot necessarily detect threat actor activity if they have returned the appliance to an apparent clean state. To assess with certainty if a device has (or had) been compromised, a forensic image of the device should be performed by contacting Ivanti support. As the external ICT will reboot the system, it is advised to take forensic evidence before running it. ## Remediation It is recommended factory resetting and upgrading, or upgrading twice the affected Ivanti systems. Ivanti shared the recovery steps related to those vulnerabilities [4]. **[Updated]** Note: Ivanti does not recommend resetting the appliances for customers who applied the patch released on January 31 or 1 February and completed a factory reset [6]. # References [1] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ivanti-warns-of-connect-secure-zero-days-exploited-in-attacks/> [2] <https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/KB-CVE-2023-46805-Authentication-Bypass-CVE-2024-21887-Command-Injection-for-Ivanti-Connect-Secure-and-Ivanti-Policy-Secure-Gateways> [3] <https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/KB44755?language=en_US> [4] <https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/Recovery-Steps-Related-to-CVE-2023-46805-and-CVE-2024-21887?language=en_US> [5] <https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/supplemental-direction-v1-ed-24-01-mitigate-ivanti-connect-secure-and-ivanti-policy-secure> [6] <https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/CVE-2024-22024-XXE-for-Ivanti-Connect-Secure-and-Ivanti-Policy-Secure?language=en_US> [7] <https://labs.watchtowr.com/are-we-now-part-of-ivanti/>"

https://cow-prod-www-v3.azurewebsites.net/publications/security-advisories/2024-032/markdown,"## Execution chain **[New]**  The execution chain also consists of multiple stages [7]: - A malicious script `build-to-host.m4` is run during the library’s build process and decodes the “test” file `bad-3-corrupt_lzma2.xz` into a bash script. - The bash script then performs a more complicated decode process on another “test” file, `good-large_compressed.lzma`, decoding it into another script - That script then extracts a shared object `liblzma_la-crc64-fast.o`, which is added to the compilation process of `liblzma` The shared object itself is compiled into `liblzma`, and replaces the regular function name resolution process. The malicious library interferes with the function resolving process, so it could replace the function pointer for the OpenSSH function `RSA_public_decrypt`. It then points that function to a malicious one of its own which, allegedly, extracts a command from the authenticating client’s certificate (after verifying that it is the one of the threat actor) and passes it on to the `system()` function for execution, thereby achieving RCE prior to authentication. # Affected Products **[Updated]** XZ Utils has been found compromised starting with version 5.6.0.

Device telemetry does not need to be enabled for PAN-OS firewalls to be exposed to attacks related to this vulnerability. One can verify whether the GlobalProtect gateway or GlobalProtect portal is configured by checking for entries in the firewall web interface (Network > GlobalProtect > Gateways or Network > GlobalProtect > Portals) [1]. # Recommendations **[Updated]** CERT-EU strongly recommends taking remediation actions depending on the exploitation level found on affected devices [5]: - **Level 0 - probing**: Unsuccessful exploitation attempt.     - Update to the latest PAN-OS hotfix;     - Create a master key [6], and  elect AES-256-GCM [7]. - **Level 1 - test**: Vulnerability being tested on the device, a 0-byte file has been created and is resident on the firewall, no indication of any known unauthorised command execution.     - Update to the latest PAN-OS hotfix.     - Create a master key [6], and  elect AES-256-GCM [7]. - **Level 2 - potential exfiltration**:  file on the device has been copied to a location accessible via a web request, though the file may or may not have been subsequently downloaded. Typically, the file we have observed being copied is `running_config.xml`. The suggested remediation will eliminate the possibility of capturing forensic artefacts.     - Engage incident response and isolate the device to be able to determine what was done on the device.     - Once it is done, update to the latest PAN-OS hotfix and perform a Private Data Reset [8]. - **Level 3 - interactive access**: Interactive command execution:  May include shell-based back doors, introduction of code, pulling files, running commands. The suggested remediation will eliminate the possibility of capturing Forensic Artifacts.     - Engage incident response and isolate the device to be able to determine what was done on the device, and in the network (in case of lateral movement).     - Once it is done, update to the latest PAN-OS hotfix and perform a Factory Reset [8]. **[Updated]** To identify the exploitation level of a device, it is advised following the verification steps suggested by the vendor described below [1]. Some mitigation steps are also available, and are described below. ## Threat Prevention Based Mitigation Customers with a Threat Prevention subscription can block attacks for this vulnerability by enabling Threat ID 95187 (introduced in Applications and Threats content version 8833-8682). In addition to enabling Threat ID 95187, customers must ensure vulnerability protection has been applied to their GlobalProtect interface to prevent exploitation of this issue on their device [2]. ## Detection Opportunities The following command can be used from the PAN-OS CLI to help identify indicators of exploit activity on the device [1]: ``` grep pattern ""failed to unmarshal session(.\+.\/"" mp-log gpsvc.log* ``` Benign `failed to unmarshal session` error logs typically appear like the following entry: ``` ""message"":""failed to unmarshal session(01234567-89ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef)"" ``` If the value between `session(` and `)` does not look like a GUID (the format shown above), but instead contains a file system path, this indicates the need for further investigation and the log entry could be related to the successful or unsuccessful exploitation of CVE-2024-3400. **[New]** Additional information provided by Volexity [9] and Unit42 [4] could be used to determine the exploitation level of an affected device. # References [1] <https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-3400> [2] <https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/globalprotect-articles/applying-vulnerability-protection-to-globalprotect-interfaces/ta-p/340184> [3] <https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-0/pan-os-admin/device-telemetry/device-telemetry-configure/device-telemetry-disable> [4] <https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cve-2024-3400/> [5] <https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA14u000000CrO6CAK> [6] <https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/certificate-management/configure-the-master-key> [7] <https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/certificate-management/master-key-encryption/configure-the-master-key-encryption-level#ida38d799c-29bb-4b3e-a7fd-f968b8affa64:~:text=DOWNLOAD%20PDF-,Configure%20Master%20Key%20Encryption%20Level,-Previous> [8] <https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA14u0000008XrDCAU> [9] <https://www.volexity.com/blog/2024/04/12/zero-day-exploitation-of-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-in-globalprotect-cve-2024-3400/>"

https://cow-prod-www-v3.azurewebsites.net/publications/security-advisories/2024-043/markdown,"# Affected Products These vulnerabilities affect Cisco ASA and FTD appliances. In order to understand if one version is affected, Cisco provides its [Cisco Software Checker tool](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x). ## CVE-2024-20353 This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software and FTD Software if they have one or more of the vulnerable configurations listed below To determine whether a device that is running Cisco ASA Software or FTD Software is affected, use the `show asp table socket | include SSL` command and look for an SSL listen socket on any TCP port. If a socket is present in the output, the device should be considered vulnerable. The following example shows the output for a Cisco ASA device with two SSL listen sockets on TCP port 443 and TCP port 8443: ```     ciscoasa#  show asp table socket | include SSL     SSL       00185038  LISTEN     172.16.0.250:443    0.0.0.0:*     SSL       00188638  LISTEN      10.0.0.250:8443    0.0.0.0:*    ``` ### ASA Software Vulnerable Configuration In the following table, the left column lists Cisco ASA Software features that are potentially vulnerable. The right column indicates the basic configuration for the feature from the `show running-config` CLI command, if it can be determined. These features could cause the SSL listen sockets to be enabled. |Cisco ASA Software Feature | Possible Vulnerable Configuration | |---|---| |AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (with client services) | crypto ikev2 enable [...] client-services port | |Local Certificate Authority (CA) | crypto ca server \\  no shutdown | |Management Web Server Access (including ASDM and CSM) | http server enable \\ http | |Mobile User Security (MUS) | webvpn \\  mus password \\  mus server enable port \\ mus | |REST API | rest-api image disk0:/rest-api agent | |SSL VPN | webvpn \\  enable | _Note: `Management Web Server Access` and `REST API` would only be vulnerable from an IP address in the configured http command range._ ### FTD Software Vulnerable Configuration In the following table, the left column lists Cisco FTD Software features that are potentially vulnerable. The right column indicates the basic configuration for the feature from the `show running-config` CLI command, if it can be determined. These features could cause the SSL listen sockets to be enabled. |Cisco FTD Software Feature | Possible Vulnerable Configuration | |---|---| |AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (with client services) | crypto ikev2 enable [...] client-services port | |AnyConnect SSL VPN | webvpn \ enable | |HTTP server enabled | http server enable \ http | ## CVE-2024-20358  Cisco FTD Software is affected only when lockdown mode has been enabled to restrict Linux shell access. Lockdown mode is disabled by default. # Recommendations CERT-EU recommends updating to the latest version of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and/or Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software product as soon as possible to mitigate these vulnerabilities. CERT-EU also recommends following the compromise assessment steps to ensure that vulnerable devices have not been exploited. ## Compromise assessment Cisco Talos has released a blog post to explain how some of these vulnerabilities have been found to be exploited [1].  1. First, organisations should look for any flows to/from ASA devices to any of the IP addresses present in the IOC list provided at the bottom of this blog. This is one indication that further investigation is necessary. 2. Additionally, organisations can issue the command `show memory region | include lina` to identify another indicator of compromise. If the output indicates more than one executable memory region (memory regions having `r-xp` permissions), especially if one of these memory sections is exactly 0x1000 bytes, then this is a sign of potential tampering.  3. It is also recommended, even in the absence of more than one executable memory region, to follow the ""Forensic Recovery and Identification of Line Runner"" steps provided in the blog post. # References [1] <https://blog.talosintelligence.com/arcanedoor-new-espionage-focused-campaign-found-targeting-perimeter-network-devices/> [2] <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-websrvs-dos-X8gNucD2> [3] <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-persist-rce-FLsNXF4h> [4] <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-cmd-inj-ZJV8Wysm>"

When suspicious activities are observed, it is recommended starting a forensic investigation. Ensure that products that are not supposed to be Internet facing are effectively not (i.e., Ivanti Policy Secure). ## Detection To identify potential compromises, we recommend running both an external and internal ICT scan on affected devices. For guidance on interpreting the results, refer to Mandiant's blog, which provides examples of successful and unsuccessful scans. If you detect any suspicious activity, contact Ivanti Support. In addition, we recommend to search in the logs for: - HTTP requests matching the following patterns: `/dana-cached/hc/hc_launcher.` likely to determine the version prior to attempting exploitation [2]. - Suspicious gaps in logging activity, which could indicate an attacker's attempt to cover their tracks [2]. # References [1] <https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/Security-Advisory-Ivanti-Connect-Secure-Policy-Secure-ZTA-Gateways-CVE-2025-0282-CVE-2025-0283?language=en_US> [2] <https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/ivanti-connect-secure-vpn-zero-day?e=48754805>"
