https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-249a,"Mitigations The authoring agencies recommend organizations implement the mitigations supplied below to improve organizational cybersecurity posture based on threat actor activity. These mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA’sCross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goalsfor more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections. LIMIT ADVERSARIAL USE OF COMMON VULNERABILITIES Prioritize patching to CISA’sKnown Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog,especially for CVEs identified in this advisory, and then critical and high vulnerabilities that allow for remote code execution on internet-facing devices.Conduct regular automated vulnerability scansto perform vulnerability assessments on all network resources based on threat actor behaviors and known exploitable vulnerabilities (CISA CPG 1.E).Limit exploitable services on internet-facing assets,such as email and remote management protocols (CISA CPGs 2.M,2.W). Where necessary services must be exposed, such as services hosted in a demilitarized zone (DMZ), implement the appropriate compensatory controls to prevent common forms of abuse and exploitation. Disable all unnecessary operating system applications and network protocols to combat adversary enumeration. For additional guidance, seeCISA Insights: Remediate Vulnerabilities for Internet-Accessible Systems.U.S. organizations can utilize a range of CISA services at no cost, including vulnerability scanning and testing, to help organizations reduce exposure to threats.CISA Cyber Hygiene services can provide additional review of internet-accessible assets and provide regular reports on steps to take to mitigate vulnerabilities. Emailvulnerability@cisa.dhs.govwith the subject line, “Requesting Cyber Hygiene Services,” to get started.Software manufacturers, vendors, and consumersare encouraged to review CISA and NIST’sDefending Against Supply Chain Attacks. This publication provides an overview of software supply chain risks and recommendations for how software customers and vendors can use the NIST Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) Framework and the Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) to identify, assess, and mitigate software supply chain risks. CISA recommends comprehensive mitigations for supply chain incident reporting, vulnerability disclosing (e.g., security.txt), and choosing a trusted supplier or vendor that observes proper cyber security hygiene (CISA CPG 1.G,1.H,1.I) to defend against upstream attacks. DEPLOY PROTECTIVE CONTROLS AND ARCHITECTURE Implement network segmentation.Network segmentation can help prevent lateral movement by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks (CISA CPG 2.F). Best practice mitigations include updating Identity and Access Management (IAM) and employing phishing-resistant MFA for all devices and accounts identified as organizational assets. For additional guidance, see CISA and NSA’sIAM Recommended Best Practices Guide for Administrators(CISA CPG 2.H).Verify and ensure that sensitive data, including credentials, are not stored in plaintext and can only be accessed by authenticated and authorized users.Credentials must be stored in a secure manner, such as with a credential/password manager to protect from malicious enumeration (CISA CPG 2.L).Disable and/or restrict use of command line and PowerShell activity.Update to the latest version and uninstall all earlier PowerShell versions (CISA CPG 2.N).Implement a continuous system monitoring program, such as security information and event management (SIEM) or endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions,to comprehensively log and review all authorized external access connections. This logging will better ensure the prompt detection of misuse or abnormal activity (CISA CPG 2.T).Monitor for unauthorized access attempts and programming anomaliesthrough comprehensive logging that is secured from modification, such as limiting permissions and adding redundant remote logging (CISA CPG 2.U). Security appliances should be set to detect and/or block Impacket framework indicators, PSExec or WMI commands, and suspicious PowerShell commands for timely identification and remediation.Identify any use of outdated or weak encryption,update these to sufficiently strong algorithms, and consider the implications of post-quantum cryptography (CISA CPG 2.K). Use properly configured and up-to-date Secure Socket Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) to protect data in transit."
https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-242a,"Mitigations NETWORK DEFENDERS The authoring organizations recommend organizations implement the mitigations below to improve cybersecurity posture based on RansomHub’s activity. These mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA’sCross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goalsfor more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections. Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive, storage device, the cloud).Require all accounts with password logins(e.g., service accounts, admin accounts, and domain admin accounts) to comply withNational Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) standardsfor developing and managing password policies.Use longer passwords consisting of at least 8 characters and no more than 64 characters in length;Store passwords in hashed format using industry-recognized password managers;Add password user “salts” to shared login credentials;Avoid reusing passwords;Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts;Disable password “hints”; andRefrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year.Note:NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users developing password “patterns” cyber criminals can easily decipher.Require administrator credentials to install software.Keep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date[CPG 1.E]. Timely patching is one of the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity threats. Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems.Require Phishing-Resistant multifactor authentication to administrator accounts[CPG 2.H] and require standard MFA for all services to the extent possible (particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems).Segment networks[CPG 2.F] to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool[CPG 3.A]. To aid in detecting the ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are particularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon network connections for each host.Install, regularly update, and enable real time detection for antivirussoftware on all hosts.Implement Secure Logging Collection and Storage Practices[CPG 2.T].Learn more about logging best practices by referencingCISA’s Logging Made Easyresources.Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directoriesfor new and/or unrecognized accounts.Audit user accountswith administrative privileges and configure access controls according to the principle of least privilege.Disable unused ports.Implement and enforce email security policies[CPG 2.M].Disable macros by default[CPG 2.N].Consider adding an email banner to emailsreceived from outside your organization.Disable hyperlinks in received emails.Implement time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher.For example, the Just-in-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the Zero Trust model). This is a process where a network-wide policy is set in place to automatically disable admin accounts at the Active Directory level when the account is not in direct need. Individual users may submit their requests through an automated process that grants them access to a specified system for a set timeframe when they need to support the completion of a certain task.Disable command-line and scripting activities and permissions.Privilege escalation and lateral movement often depend on software utilities running from the command line. If threat actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or moving laterally.Maintain offline backups of data, and regularly maintain backup and restoration[CPG 2.R]. By instituting this practice, the organization ensures they will not be severely interrupted, and/or only have irretrievable data.Ensure all backup data is encrypted,immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization’s data infrastructure. SOFTWARE MANUFACTURERS The above mitigations apply to enterprises and critical infrastructure organizations with on-premises or hybrid environments. Recognizing that insecure software is the root cause of many of these flaws and that the responsibility should not be on the end user, CISA urges software manufacturers to implement the following to reduce the prevalence of identified or exploited issues (e.g., misconfigurations, weak passwords, and other weaknesses identified and exploited through the assessment team): Embed security into product architecturethroughout the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC).Mandate MFA, ideally phishing-resistant MFA, for privileged usersand make MFA a default, rather than opt-in, feature. These mitigations align with tactics provided in the joint guideShifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Secure by Design Software. CISA urges software manufacturers to take ownership of improving the security outcomes of their customers by applying these and other secure by design tactics. By using secure by design tactics, software manufacturers can make their product lines secure “out of the box” without requiring customers to spend additional resources making configuration changes, purchasing security software and logs, monitoring, and making routine updates.

The FBI and CISA recommend all organizations implement the following mitigations: Review available logs for IP addresses inTable 10for indications of traffic with your organization’s network in the provided timeframes [CPG 3.A]. The indicators in Table 11 should also be reviewed to identify historical activity or incidents which may have previously been identified by your organization.Apply patches and/or mitigations for CVE-2024-3400, CVE-2022-1388, CVE-2019-19781, and CVE-2023-3519 [CPG 1.E].Be advised, patching for the above referenced CVEs may be insufficient to mitigate malicious activity if your network has already been compromised by these actors while the network device was vulnerable. Additional investigation into the use of stolen credentials (e.g., via the webshell on Netscaler devices) is strongly encouraged to identify threat actor attempts to establish footholds on other parts of the network [CPG 3.A].Check your systems for the unique identifiers and TTPs used by the actors when operating on compromised networks, including creation of specific usernames, use of NGROK and Ligolo, and deployment of webshells in specific directories [CPG 3.A].Check your systems for outbound web requests tofiles.catbox[.]moeand***.ngrok[.]io[CPG 3.A]."

LOG4SHELL AND OTHER LOG4J VULNERABILITIES Defenders should consult the joint Cybersecurity Advisory titled “Mitigating Log4Shell and Other Log4j-Related Vulnerabilities” and CISA’s “Apache Log4j Vulnerability” guidance. Organizations can mitigate the risks posed by the vulnerability by identifying assets affected by Log4Shell and other Log4j-related vulnerabilities and upgrading Log4j assets and affected products to the latest version. Note:CVE-2021-44228 ‘Log4Shell’ was disclosed in December 2021 and affects the Log4j library prior to version 2.17.0. Defenders should remain alert to vendor software updates, and initiate hunt and incident response procedures to detect possible Log4Shell exploitation. WEB SHELL MALWARE Web shell malware is deployed by adversaries on a victim’s web server to execute arbitrary system commands. The NSA and Australian Signals Directorate’s report titled “Detect and Prevent Web Shell Malware” provides mitigating actions to identify and recover from web shells. Preventing exploitation of web-facing servers often depends on maintaining an inventory of systems and applications, rapidly applying patches as they are released, putting vulnerable or potentially risky systems behind reverse proxies that require authentication, and deploying and configuring Web Application Firewalls (WAFs). ENDPOINT ACTIVITY Preventing and detecting further adversary activity should focus on deploying endpoint agents or other monitoring mechanisms, blocking unnecessary outbound connections, blocking external access to administrator panels and services or turning them off entirely, and segmenting the network to prevent lateral movement from a compromised web server to critical assets. COMMAND LINE ACTIVITY AND REMOTE ACCESS Monitoring for suspicious command-line activity, implementing multi-factor authentication for remote access services, and properly segmenting and using allow-listing tools for critical assets can protect against malicious activity by RGB 3rd Bureau’s Andariel group and other cyber threat actors. PACKING Signatures for Themida, VMProtect and a number of other packers are availablehere, however, the signatures will not identify every file packed using these applications. ADDITIONAL MITIGATION MEASURES FOR MALICIOUS ACTIVITIES Check for security vulnerabilities, apply patches, and update to the latest version of softwareEncrypt all sensitive data including personal informationBlock access to unused portsChange passwords when they are suspected of being compromisedAlert on unexpected use of dual-use applicationsStrengthen the subscriber identity authentication process for leased servers DPRK REWARDS FOR JUSTICE The U.S. and ROK Governments encourage victims to report suspicious activities, including those related to suspected DPRK cyber activities, to relevant authorities. If you provide information about illicit DPRK activities in cyberspace, including past or ongoing operations, you may be eligible for a reward. If you have information about illicit DPRK activities in cyberspace, including past or ongoing operations, providing such information through the Department of State’s Rewards for Justice program could make you eligible to receive an award of up to $10 million.

https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-193a,"MITIGATIONS NETWORK DEFENDERS CISA recommends organizations implement the recommendations in Table 1 to mitigate the findings listed in the Lessons Learned and Key Findings section of this advisory. These mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. See CISA’sCross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goalsfor more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections. CISA recommends organizations implement the recommendations in Table 2 to mitigate other identified issues that can be uncovered through traditional penetration tests or red team assessments. Note:The above mitigations apply to critical infrastructure organizations with on-premises or hybrid environments. CISA encourage all organizations toprioritize purchasing products from manufacturers who demonstrate secure by design principles, such as evidenced by follow-on publications from companies who have signed theSecure by Design Pledge. SOFTWARE MANUFACTURERS CISA recognizes that insecure software is the root cause of many flaws; the responsibility should not rest on the end user. CISA urges software manufacturers to implement the following: Eliminate default passwordsand determine what password practices should be required (such as minimum password length and disallowing known breached passwords). Configure software to use more secure authentication schemes by default.Provide logging at no additional charge. Cloud services and on-premises products should commit to generating and storing security related logs at no additional cost.Work with security information and event management (SIEM) and security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) providers—in conjunction with customers—to understand how response teams use logs to investigate incidents. The goal is to develop logs that yield a comprehensive story of the event.Remove unnecessary software dependencies. Unnecessary software increases the attack surface available to adversaries and may introduce additional vulnerabilities. Mitigating these additional vulnerabilities requires significant investment, consuming resources like time, technical personnel, and adding to the level of security effort. These mitigations align with tactics provided in the joint guideShifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Secure by Design Software. CISA urges software manufacturers to take ownership of improving the security outcomes of their customers by applying these and other secure by design tactics. By using secure by design tactics, software manufacturers can make their product lines secure “out of the box” without requiring customers to spend additional resources making configuration changes, purchasing security software and logs, monitoring, and making routine updates.

https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-190a,"Detection and mitigation recommendations The ASD’s ACSC strongly recommends implementing the ASDEssential EightControls and associatedStrategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents. Below are recommendations for network security actions that should be taken to detect and prevent intrusions by APT40, followed by specific mitigations for four key TTPs summarized in Table 1. DETECTION Some of the files identified above were dropped in locations such as C:\Users\Public\* and C:\Windows\ Temp\*. These locations can be convenient spots for writing data as they are usually world writable, that is, all user accounts registered in Windows have access to these directories and their subdirectories. Often, any user can subsequently access these files, allowing opportunities for lateral movement, defense evasion, low-privilege execution and staging for exfiltration. The following Sigma rules look for execution from suspicious locations as an indicator of anomalous activity. In all instances, subsequent investigation is required to confirm malicious activity and attribution. MITIGATIONS During ASD’s ACSC investigations, a common issue that reduces the effectiveness and speed of investigative efforts is a lack of comprehensive and historical logging information across a number of areas including web server request logs, Windows event logs and internet proxy logs. ASD’s ACSC recommends reviewing and implementing their guidance onWindows Event Logging and Forwardingincluding the configuration files and scripts in theWindows Event Logging Repositoryand the Information Security Manual’sGuidelines for System Monitoring, to include centralizing logs and retaining logs for a suitable period. Promptly patch all internet exposed devices and services, including web servers, web applications, and remote access gateways. Consider implementing a centralized patch management system to automate and expedite the process. ASD’s ACSC recommend implementation of the ISM’sGuidelines for System Management, specifically, the System Patching controls where applicable. Most exploits utilized by the actor were publicly known and had patches or mitigations available. Organizations should ensure that security patches or mitigations are applied to internet facing infrastructure within 48 hours, and where possible, use the latest versions of software and operating systems. Network segmentation can make it significantly more difficult for adversaries to locate and gain access to an organizations sensitive data. Segment networks to limit or block lateral movement by denying traffic between computers unless required. Important servers such as Active Directory and other authentication servers should only be able to be administered from a limited number of intermediary servers or “jump servers.” These servers should be closely monitored, be well secured and limit which users and devices are able to connect to them. Regardless of instances identified where lateral movement is prevented, additional network segmentation could have further limited the amount of data the actors were able to access and extract. The authoring agencies also recommend the following mitigations to combat APT40 and others’ use of the TTPs below. Disable unused or unnecessary network services, ports and protocols.Use well-tuned Web application firewalls (WAFs) to protect webservers and applications.Enforce least privilege to limit access to servers, file shares, and other resources.Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) and managed service accounts to make credentials harder to crack and reuse. MFA should be applied to all internet accessible remote access services, including:Web and cloud-based email;Collaboration platforms;Virtual private network connections; andRemote desktop services.Replace end-of-life equipment. For additional general detection and mitigation advice, please consult the Mitigations and Detection sections on the MITRE ATT&CK technique web page for each of the techniques identified in the MITRE ATT&CK summary at the end of this advisory."

Implement a recovery planto maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (e.g., hard drive, storage device, the cloud) [CPG 2.F,2.R,2.S].Require all accountswith password logins (e.g., service accounts, admin accounts, and domain admin accounts)to complywith NIST’sstandards. In particular, require employees to use long passwords and consider not requiring recurring password changes, as these can weaken security [CPG 2.C].Require multifactor authenticationfor all services to the extent possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems [CPG 2.H].Keep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date.Timely patching is one of the most efficient and cost effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity threats. Prioritize patchingknown exploited vulnerabilitiesin internet-facing systems. [CPG 1.E].Segment networksto prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement [CPG 2.F].Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool.To aid in detecting the ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are particularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon network connections for each host [CPG 3.A].Filter network trafficby preventing unknown or untrusted origins from accessing remote services on internal systems. This prevents threat actors from directly connecting to remote access services that they have established for persistence.Install, regularly update, and enable real time detection for antivirus softwareon all hosts.Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directoriesfor new and/or unrecognized accounts [CPG 1.A,2.O].Audit user accountswith administrative privileges and configure access controls according to the principle of least privilege [CPG 2.E].Disable unusedports[CPG 2.V].Consider adding an email banner to emailsreceived from outside of your organization [CPG 2.M].Disable hyperlinksin received emails.Implement time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher.For example, the Just-in-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as theZero Trust model). This is a process where a network-wide policy is set in place to automatically disable admin accounts at the Active Directory level when the account is not in direct need. Individual users may submit their requests through an automated process that grants them access to a specified system for a set timeframe when they need to support the completion of a certain task.Disable command-line and scripting activities and permissions.Privilege escalation and lateral movement often depend on software utilities running from the command line. If threat actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or moving laterally [CPG 2.E,2.N].Maintain offline backups of data,and regularly maintain backup and restoration [CPG 2.R]. By instituting this practice, the organization helps ensure they will not be severely interrupted, and/or only have irretrievable data.Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable(i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization’s data infrastructure [CPG 2.K,2.L,2.R]."

Additionally, the victim organization disabled unnecessary administrator accounts and enabled MFA for all administrator accounts. To prevent similar compromises, CISA and MS-ISAC recommend the following: Review current administrator accountsto determine their necessity and only maintain administrator accounts that are essential for network management. This will reduce the attack surface and focus efforts on the security and monitoring of necessary accounts.Restrict the use of multiple administrator accountsfor one user.Create separate administrator accountsfor on-premises and Azure environments to segment access.Implement the principle of least privilegeto decrease threat actor’s ability to access key network resources. Enable just-in-time and just enough access for administrator accounts to elevate the minimum necessary privileges for a limited time to complete tasks.Use phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA)[CPG 2.H] (e.g., security tokens) for remote access and access to any sensitive data repositories. Implement phishing-resistant MFA for as many services as possible—particularly for webmail and VPNs—for accounts that access critical systems and privileged accounts that manage backups.MFA should also be used for remote logins [M1032]. For additional guidance on secure MFA configurations, visit CISA’sMore than a Passwordwebpage and read CISA’sImplementing Phishing-Resistant MFAfact sheet. REDUCE ATTACK SURFACE Unnecessary accounts, software, and services in the network create additional vectors for a threat actor to compromise. CISA and MS-ISAC recommend the following: Establish policy and procedure for the prompt removal of unnecessary accounts and groupsfrom the enterprise, especially privileged accounts. Organizations should implement a robust and continuous user management process to ensure accounts of offboarded employees are removed and can no longer access the network.Maintain a robust asset management policythrough comprehensive documentation of assets, tracking current version information to maintain awareness of outdated software, and mapping assets to business and critical functions.Determine the need and functionality of assets that require public internet exposure [CPG 1.A].Follow a routine patching cyclefor all operating systems, applications, and software (including all third-party software) to mitigate the potential for exploitation.Restrict personal devices from connecting to the network. Personal devices are not subject to the same group policies and security measures as domain joined devices. EVALUATE TENANT SETTINGS By default, in Azure AD all users can register and manage all aspects of applications they create. Users can also determine and approve what organizational data and services the application can access. These default settings can enable a threat actor to access sensitive information and move laterally in the network. In addition, users who create an Azure AD automatically become the Global Administrator for that tenant. This could allow a threat actor to escalate privileges to execute malicious actions. CISA and MS-ISAC recommend the following: Evaluate current user permissionsin the Azure tenant to restrict potentially harmful permissions including:Restrict users’ ability to register applications. By default, all users in Azure AD can register and manage the applications they create and approve the data and services the application can access. If this is exploited, a threat actor can access sensitive information and move laterally in the network.Restrict non-administrators from creating tenants. Any user who creates an Azure AD automatically becomes the Global Administrator for that tenant. This creates an opportunity for a threat actor to escalate privileges to the highest privileged account.Restrict access to the Azure AD portal to administrators only. Users without administrative privileges cannot change settings, however, they can view user info, group info, device details, and user privileges. This would allow a threat actor to gather valuable information for malicious activities. CREATE A FORENSICALLY READY ORGANIZATION Collect access- and security-focused logs(e.g., intrusion detection systems/intrusion prevention systems, firewall, data loss prevention, and virtual private network) for use in both detection and incident response activities [CPG 2.T].Enable complete coverage of tools, including Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), across the environment for thorough analysis of anomalous activity and remediation of potential vulnerabilities. ASSESS SECURITY CONFIGURATION OF AZURE ENVIRONMENT CISA created theSecure Cloud and Business Applications (SCuBA)assessment tool to help Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to verify that a M365 tenant configuration conforms to a minimal viable secure configuration baseline. Although the SCuBA assessment tool was developed for FCEB, other organizations can benefit from its output. CISA and MS-ISAC recommend the following: Use tools that identify attack paths. This will enable defenders to identify common attack paths used by threat actors and shut them down before they are exploited.Review the security recommendations list provided by Microsoft 365 Defender. Focus remediation on critical vulnerabilities on endpoints that are essential to mission execution and contain sensitive data. EVALUATE CONDITIONAL ACCESS POLICIES Conditional access policies require users who want to access a resource to complete an action. Conditional access policies also account for common signals, such as user or group memberships, IP location information, device, application, and risky sign-in behavior identified through integration with Azure AD Identity Protection. Review current conditional access policiesto determine if changes are necessary. RESET ALL PASSWORDS AND ESTABLISH SECURE PASSWORD POLICIES In response to the incident, the victim organization reset passwords for all users. Employ strong password managementalongside other attribute-based information, such as device information, time of access, user history, and geolocation data. Set a password policy to require complex passwords for all users (minimum of 16 characters) and enforce this new requirement as user passwords expire [CPG 2.A],[CPG 2.B],[CPG 2.C].Store credentials in a secure manner,such as with a credential manager, vault, or other privileged account management solution [CPG 2.L].For products that come with default passwords,ask vendors how they plan to eliminate default passwords, as highlighted inCISA’s Secure by Design Alert: How Manufacturers Can Protect Customers by Eliminating Default Passwords. MITIGATIONS FOR VENDORS CISA recommends that vendors incorporatesecure by designprinciples and tactics into their practices, limiting the impact of threat actor techniques and strengthening the secure posture for their customers. Prioritize secure by default configurations,such as eliminating default passwords and providing high-quality audit logs to customers with no additional configuration, at no extra charge. Secure by default configurations should be prioritized to eliminate the need for customer implementation of hardening guidance.Immediately identify, mitigate, and update affected productsthat are not patched in accordance with CISA’sKnown Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.Implement multifactor authentication (MFA),ideallyphishing-resistant MFA, as a default (rather than opt-in) feature for all products."
https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-038a,"MITIGATIONS These mitigationsare intended for IT administrators in critical infrastructure organizations. The authoring agencies recommend that software manufactures incorporate secure by design and default principles and tactics into their software development practices to strengthen the security posture for their customers. For information on secure by design practices that may protect customers against common Volt Typhoon techniques, see joint guideIdentifying and Mitigating Living off the Land Techniquesand joint Secure by Design AlertSecurity Design Improvements for SOHO Device Manufacturers. For more information on secure by design, see CISA’sSecure by Designwebpage andjoint guide. The authoring agencies recommend organizations implement the mitigations below to improve your organization’s cybersecurity posture on the basis of Volt Typhoon activity. These mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA’sCross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goalsfor more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections. IT NETWORK ADMINISTRATORS AND DEFENDERS Apply patches for internet-facing systems within a risk-informed span of time[CPG 1E]. Prioritize patching critical assets,known exploited vulnerabilities, and vulnerabilities in appliances known to be frequently exploited by Volt Typhoon (e.g., Fortinet, Ivanti, NETGEAR, Citrix, and Cisco devices).Apply vendor-provided or industry standard hardening guidanceto strengthen software and system configurations.Note:As part of CISA’sSecure by Design campaign, CISA urges software manufacturers to prioritize secure by default configurations to eliminate the need for customer implementation of hardening guidelines.Maintain and regularly update an inventory of all organizational IT assets[CPG 1A].Use third party assessments to validate current system and network security compliancevia security architecture reviews, penetration tests, bug bounties, attack surface management services, incident simulations, or table-top exercises (both announced and unannounced) [CPG 1F].Limit internet exposure of systems when not necessary. An organization’s primary attack surface is the combination of the exposure of all its internet-facing systems. Decrease the attack surface by not exposing systems or management interfaces to the internet when not necessary.Plan “end of life” for technology beyond manufacturer supported lifecycle. Inventories of organizational assets should be leveraged in patch and configuration management as noted above. Inventories will also enable identification of technology beyond the manufacturer’s supported lifecycle. Where technology is beyond “end of life” or “end of support,” additional cybersecurity vigilance is necessary, and may warrant one or more of the following:Supplemental support agreements;Additional scanning and testing;Configuration changes;Isolation;Segmentation; andDevelopment of forward-looking plans to facilitate replacement. Do not store credentials on edge appliances/devices.Ensure edge devices do not contain accounts that could provide domain admin access.Do not store plaintext credentials on any system[CPG 2L]. Credentials should be stored securely—such as with a credential/password manager or vault, or other privileged account management solutions—so they can only be accessed by authenticated and authorized users.Change default passwords[CPG 2A] and ensure they meet the policy requirements for complexity.Implement and enforce an organizational system-enforced policy that:Requires passwords for all IT password-protected assets to be at least 15 characters;Does not allow users to reuse passwords for accounts, applications, services, etc., [CPG 2C]; andDoes not allow service accounts/machine accounts to reuse passwordsfrom member user accounts.Configure Group Policy settings to prevent web browsers from saving passwordsand disable autofill functions.Disable the storage of clear text passwords in LSASS memory. Implementphishing-resistant MFAfor access to assets [CPG 2H].Separate user and privileged accounts.User accounts should never have administrator or super-user privileges [CPG 2E].Administrators should never use administrator accounts for actions and activities not associated with the administrator role (e.g., checking email, web browsing).Enforce the principle of least privilege.Ensure administrator accounts only have the minimum permissionsnecessary to complete their tasks.Review account permissions for default/accounts for edge appliances/devices and remove domain administrator privileges,if identified.Significantly limit the number of users with elevated privileges. Implement continuous monitoring for changes in group membership, especially in privileged groups, to detect and respond to unauthorized modifications.Remove accounts from high-privilege groups like Enterprise Admins and Schema Admins. Temporarily reinstate these privileges only when necessary and under strict auditing to reduce the risk of privilege abuse.Transition to Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSAs)where suitable for enhanced management and security of service account credentials. gMSAs provide automated password management and simplified Service Principal Name (SPN) management, enhancing security over traditional service accounts. See Microsoft’sGroup Managed Service Accounts Overview.Enforce strict policies via Group Policy and User Rights Assignmentsto limit high-privilege service accounts.Consider using a privileged access management (PAM) solutionto manage access to privileged accounts and resources [CPG 2L]. PAM solutions can also log and alert usage to detect any unusual activity.Complement the PAM solution with role-based access control (RBAC)for tailored access based on job requirements. This ensures that elevated access is granted only when required and for a limited duration, minimizing the window of opportunity for abuse or exploitation of privileged credentials.Implement an Active Directory tiering model to segregate administrative accountsbased on their access level and associated risk. This approach reduces the potential impact of a compromised account. See Microsoft’sPAM environment tier model.Harden administrative workstationsto only permit administrative activities from workstations appropriately hardened based on the administrative tier. See Microsoft’sWhy are privileged access devices important - Privileged access.Disable all user accounts and access to organizational resources of employees on the day of their departure[CPG 2G]Regularly audit all user, admin, and service accountsand remove or disable unused or unneeded accounts as applicable.Regularly roll NTLM hashes of accounts that support token-based authentication.Improve management of hybrid (cloud and on-premises) identity federation by:Using cloud only administrators that are asynchronous with on-premises environmentsand ensuring on-premises administrators are asynchronous to the cloud.Using CISA’sSCuBAGear toolto discover cloud misconfigurations in Microsoft cloud tenants. SCuBA gear is automation script for comparing Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agency tenant configurations against CISA M365 baseline recommendations. SCuBAGear is part of CISA’s Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) project, which provides guidance for FCEB agencies, securing their cloud business application environments and protecting federal information created, accessed, shared, and stored in those environments. Although tailored to FCEB agencies, the project provides security guidance applicable to all organizations with cloud environments. For more information on SCuBAGear see CISA’sSecure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) Project.Using endpoint detection and response capabilities to activelydefend on-premises federation servers. Limit the use of RDP and other remote desktop services. If RDP is necessary, apply best practices, including auditing the network for systems using RDP, closing unused RDP ports, and logging RDP login attempts.Disable Server Message Block (SMB) protocol version 1 and upgrade to version 3 (SMBv3)after mitigating existing dependencies (on existing systems or applications), as they may break when disabled.Harden SMBv3by implementing guidance included in joint#StopRansomware Guide(see page 8 of the guide).Apply mitigations from the jointGuide to Securing Remote Access Software. Securely store sensitive data(including operational technology documentation, network diagrams, etc.), ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can access the data. Ensure that sensitive accounts use their administrator credentials only on hardened, secure computers. This practice can reduce lateral movement exposure within networks.Conduct comprehensive trust assessments to identify business-critical trusts and apply necessary controlsto prevent unauthorized cross-forest/domain traversal.Harden federated authentication by enabling Secure Identifier (SID) Filtering and Selective Authentication on AD trust relationshipsto further restrict unauthorized access across domain boundaries.Implement network segmentation to isolate federation serversfrom other systems and limit allowed traffic to systems and protocols that require access in accordance with Zero Trust principles. Harden cloud assetsin accordance with vendor-provided or industry standard hardening guidance.Organizations with Microsoft cloud infrastructure, see CISA’sMicrosoft 365 Security Configuration Baseline Guides, which provide minimum viable secure configuration baselines for Microsoft Defender for Office 365, Azure Active Directory (now known as Microsoft Entra ID), Exchange Online, OneDrive for Business, Power BI, Power Platform, SharePoint Online, and Teams. For additional guidance, see the Australian Signals Directorate’sBlueprint for Secure Cloud.Organizations with Google cloud infrastructure, see CISA’sGoogle Workspace Security Configuration Baseline Guides, which provide minimum viable secure configuration baselines for Groups for Business, GMAIL, Google Calendar, Google Chat, Google Common Controls, Google Classroom, Google Drive and Docs, Google Meet, and Google Sites.Revoke unnecessary public access to cloud environment.This involves reviewing and restricting public endpoints and ensuring that services like storage accounts, databases, and virtual machines are not publicly accessible unless absolutely necessary. Disable legacy authentication protocols across all cloud services and platforms. Legacy protocols frequently lack support for advanced security mechanisms such as multifactor authentication, rendering them susceptible to compromises. Instead, enforce the use of modern authentication protocols that support stronger security features like MFA, token-based authentication, and adaptive authentication measures.Enforce this practice through the use of Conditional Access Policies. These policies can initially be run in report-only mode to identify potential impacts and plan mitigations before fully enforcing them. This approach allows organizations to systematically control access to their cloud resources, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential compromise.Regularly monitor and audit privileged cloud-based accounts, including service accounts, which are frequently abused to enable broad cloud resource access and persistence. Ensure logging is turned on for application, access, and security logs(e.g., intrusion detection systems/intrusion prevention systems, firewall, data loss prevention, and VPNs) [CPG 2T]. Given Volt Typhoon’s use of LOTL techniques and their significant dwell time, application event logs may be a valuable resource to hunt for Volt Typhoon activity because these logs typically remain on endpoints for relatively long periods of time.For OT assets where logs are non-standard or not available,collect network traffic and communications between those assets and other assets.Implement file integrity monitoring (FIM) tools to detect unauthorized changes.Store logs in a central system, such as a security information and event management (SIEM) tool or central database.Ensure the logs can only be accessed or modified by authorized and authenticated users[CPG 2U].Store logs for a period informed by risk or pertinent regulatory guidelines.Tune log alerting to reduce noise while ensuring there are alerts for high-risk activities. (For information on alert tuning, see joint guideIdentifying and Mitigating Living Off the Land Techniques.)Establish and continuously maintain a baseline of installed tools and software, account behavior, and network traffic. This way, network defenders can identify potential outliers, which may indicate malicious activity.Note:For information on establishing a baseline, see joint guideIdentifying and Mitigating Living off the Land Techniques.Document a list of threats and cyber actor TTPs relevant to your organization(e.g., based on industry or sectors), and maintain the ability (such as via rules, alerting, or commercial prevention and detection systems) to detect instances of those key threats [CPG 3A].Implement periodic training for all employees and contractors that covers basic security concepts(such as phishing, business email compromise, basic operational security, password security, etc.), as well as fostering an internal culture of security and cyber awareness [CPG 2I].Tailor the training to network IT personnel/administrators and other key staff based on relevant organizational cyber threats and TTPs, such as Volt Typhoon. For example, communicate that Volt Typhoon actors are known to target personal email accounts of IT staff, and encourage staff to protect their personal email accounts by using strong passwords and implementing MFA.In addition to basic cybersecurity training,ensure personnel who maintain or secure OT as part of their regular duties receive OT-specific cybersecurity trainingon at least an annual basis [CPG 2J].Educate users about the risks associated with storing unprotected passwords. OT ADMINISTRATORS AND DEFENDERS Change default passwords[CPG 2A] and ensure they meet the policy requirements for complexity. If the asset’s password cannot be changed, implement compensating controls for the device; for example, segment the device into separate enclaves and implement increased monitoring and logging.Require that passwords for all OT password-protected assets be at least 15 characters, when technically feasible. In instances where minimum passwords lengths are not technically feasible (for example, assets in remote locations), apply compensating controls, record the controls, and log all login attempts. [CPG 2B].Enforce strict access policies for accessing OT networks. Develop strict operating procedures for OT operators that details secure configuration and usage.Segment OT assets from IT environmentsby [CPG 2F]:Denying all connections to the OT network by defaultunless explicitly allowed (e.g., by IP address and port) for specific system functionality.Requiring necessary communications paths between IT and OT networks to pass through an intermediary, such as a properly configured firewall, bastion host, “jump box,” or a demilitarized zone (DMZ), which is closely monitored, captures network logs, and only allows connections from approved assets.Closely monitor all connections into OT networks for misuse, anomalous activity, or OT protocols.Monitor for unauthorized controller change attempts. Implement integrity checks of controller process logic against a known good baseline. Ensure process controllers are prevented from remaining in remote program mode while in operation if possible.Lock or limit set points in control processes to reduce the consequences of unauthorized controller access.Be preparedby:Determining your critical operational processes’ reliance on key IT infrastructure:Maintain and regularly update an inventory of all organizational OT assets.Understand and evaluate cyber risk on “as-operated” OT assets.Create an accurate “as-operated” OT network map and identify OT and IT network inter-dependencies.Identifying a resilience plan that addresses how to operate if you lose access to or control of the IT and/or OT environment.Plan for how to continue operations if a control system is malfunctioning, inoperative, or actively acting contrary to the safe and reliable operation of the process.Develop workarounds or manual controls to ensure ICS networks can be isolated if the connection to a compromised IT environment creates risk to the safe and reliable operation of OT processes.Create and regularly exercise an incident response plan.Regularly test manual controls so that critical functions can be kept running if OT networks need to be taken offline.Implement regular data backup procedureson OT networks.Regularly test backup procedures.Follow risk-informed guidancein the joint advisoryNSA and CISA Recommend Immediate Actions to Reduce Exposure Across all Operational Technologies and Control Systems, the NSA advisoryStop Malicious Cyber Activity Against Connected Operational Technology."
