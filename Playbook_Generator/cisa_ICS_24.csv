If an immediate update is not feasible, AutomationDirect recommends considering the following interim steps until the programming software can be updated: Isolate the Engineering Workstation: Disconnect the workstation from external networks (e.g., internet or corporate LAN) to limit exposure to external threats.Use dedicated, secure internal networks or air-gapped systems for communication with programmable devices. Control Access: Restrict physical and logical access to the workstation to authorized personnel only.Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and robust password policies for user accounts. Implement Whitelisting: Use application whitelisting to allow only pre-approved and trusted software to execute on the workstation.Block untrusted or unauthorized applications. Apply Endpoint Security Measures: Use antivirus or endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to monitor for and mitigate threats.Ensure that host-based firewalls are properly configured to block unauthorized access. Monitor and Log Activity: Enable logging and monitoring of system activities to detect potential anomalies or unauthorized actions.Regularly review logs for suspicious activity. Harden the Workstation: Remove or disable unnecessary services and software to reduce the attack surface.Implement security configurations, such as disabling autorun for USB drives or restricting administrative privileges. Use Secure Backup and Recovery: Regularly back up the workstation and its configurations to a secure location.Test recovery procedures to ensure minimal downtime in the event of an incident. Conduct Regular Risk Assessments: Continuously assess the risks posed by the outdated software and adjust mitigation measures as necessary.

MITIGATIONS Hitachi Energy recommends that users apply the update as soon as it is available. in the meantime, Hitachi Energy recommends the general mitigation factors/workarounds given below are followed. MSM is not intrinsically designed and intended to be directly connected to the internet. Please disconnect the device from any internet facing network, if any installation has performed the same. Hitachi Energy suggests adopting user access management and any state-of-the-art antivirus protection engines equipped with the latest signature rules on the computers that have installed and operating the MSM Client application. As an example, please use the operating system (OS) inbuilt user access management functionality, if supported, to limit the probability of unauthorized access followed by rogue commands via MSM Client application. Also, Hitachi Energy recommends following the hardening guidelines published by""The Center for Internet Security (CIS)""to protect the host operating system of computers that connects with MSM. This measure would then prevent the lateral movement of the attack vector into MSM via these connected devices. Some examples for Windows based computers are listed below: 1)CIS Microsoft Windows Desktop Benchmarks2)CIS Microsoft Windows Server Benchmarks Hitachi Energy has provided the additional following security practices and firewall configurations can help protect a process control network from attacks that originate from outside the network: Physically protect process control systems from direct access by unauthorized personnel.Do not connect directly to the Internet.Separate from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports exposed.Process control systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e-mails.Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system.

MITIGATIONS Version 8.2 of EcoStruxure IT Data Center Expert includes fixes for these vulnerabilities and is available upon request fromSchneider Electric's Customer Care Center. Users should use appropriate patching methodologies when applying these patches to their systems. Schneider Electric strongly recommends the use of back-ups and evaluating the impact of these patches in a test and development environment or on an offline infrastructure. ContactSchneider Electric's Customer Care Centerif you need assistance removing a patch. If users choose not to apply the remediation provided above, they should immediately apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit: Ensure that the principals of least privilege are being followed so that only those with need have account access and that the level of their respective account authorization aligns with their role, including privileged accounts as described in theData Center Expert Security Handbook.Verify SHA1 checksums of upgrade bundles prior to executing upgrades as described in the Upgrades section of theData Center Expert Security Handbook.Delete any existing ""logcapture"" archives present on the system and do not create any new ""logcapture"" archives. Existing archives can be deleted from the https://server_ip/capturelogs web page after authenticating. Schneider Electric strongly recommends the following industry cybersecurity best practices: Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the ""Program"" mode.Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device.Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.

MITIGATIONS As part of their ongoing risk assessment, AutomationDirect has determined that the H2-DM1E, due to its age and inherent architectural limitations, can no longer be supported within the secure development lifecycle. To address these challenges, AutomationDirect recommends the following mitigation strategies based on a thorough risk assessment: Upgrade to the BRX platform: Transitioning to the BRX platform is strongly advised, as it is designed to meet current security standards and is actively maintained within AutomationDirect's secure development lifecycle.Network segmentation and air gapping: To mitigate risks associated with the H2-DM1E, AutomationDirect recommends implementing network segmentation and air gapping. This strategy will isolate the older technology from the broader network, reducing its exposure to external threats and minimizing the impact of any security vulnerabilities.Deploy a StrideLinx secure VPN platform: AutomationDirect also recommends placing the system behind a StrideLinx VPN platform. These mitigation strategies provide a comprehensive approach to managing the risks associated with the H2-DM1E while preparing for future security needs.Please reach out to AutomationDirectif you have any further questions or require additional details on these recommendations.
