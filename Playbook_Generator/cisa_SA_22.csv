https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-335a,"Mitigations FBI and CISA recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the risk of compromise by Cuba ransomware: Implement a recovery planto maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive, storage device, the cloud).Require all accountswith password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and domain admin accounts)to complywithNational Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) standardsfor developing and managing password policies.Use longer passwords consisting of at least 8 characters and no more than 64 characters in length.Store passwords in hashed format using industry-recognized password managers.Add password user “salts” to shared login credentials.Avoid reusing passwords.Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts.Disable password “hints.”Refrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year.Note:NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users developing password “patterns” cyber criminals can easily decipher.Require administrator credentials to install software.Requiremultifactor authenticationfor all services to the extent possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems.Keep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date.Timely patching is one of the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity threats. Prioritize patching SonicWall firewall vulnerabilities andknown exploited vulnerabilitiesin internet-facing systems.Note:SonicWall maintains a vulnerability list that includes Advisory ID, CVE, and mitigation. Their list can be found atpsirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-list.Segment networksto prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool.To aid in detecting the ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are particularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon network connections for each host.Install, regularly update, and enable real time detection for antivirus softwareon all hosts.Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directoriesfor new and/or unrecognized accounts.Audit user accountswith administrative privileges and configure access controls according to the principle of least privilege.Disable unused ports.Consider adding an email banner to emailsreceived from outside your organization.Disable hyperlinksin received emails.Implement time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher.For example, the Just-in-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the Zero Trust model). JIT sets a network-wide policy in place to automatically disable admin accounts at the Active Directory level when the account is not in direct need. Individual users may submit their requests through an automated process that grants them access to a specified system for a set timeframe when they need to support the completion of a certain task.Disable command-line and scripting activities and permissions.Privilege escalation and lateral movement often depend on software utilities running from the command line. If threat actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or moving laterally.Maintain offline backups of data,and regularly maintain backup and restoration. By instituting this practice, the organization ensures they will not be severely interrupted, and/or only have irretrievable data.Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable(i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization’s data infrastructure. Use longer passwords consisting of at least 8 characters and no more than 64 characters in length.Store passwords in hashed format using industry-recognized password managers.Add password user “salts” to shared login credentials.Avoid reusing passwords.Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts.Disable password “hints.”Refrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year.Note:NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular and frequent password resets.

If your organization is impacted by a ransomware incident, FBI, CISA, and HHS recommend the following actions. Isolate the infected system. Remove the infected system from all networks, and disable the computer’s wireless, Bluetooth, and any other potential networking capabilities. Ensure all shared and networked drives are disconnected.Turn off other computers and devices. Power-off and segregate (i.e., remove from the network) the infected computer(s). Power-off and segregate any other computers or devices that share a network with the infected computer(s) that have not been fully encrypted by ransomware. If possible, collect and secure all infected and potentially infected computers and devices in a central location, making sure to clearly label any computers that have been encrypted. Powering-off and segregating infected computers and computers that have not been fully encrypted may allow for the recovery of partially encrypted files by specialists.Secure your backups. Ensure that your backup data is offline and secure. If possible, scan your backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is free of malware. In addition, FBI, CISA, and HHS urge all organizations to apply the following recommendations to prepare for, mitigate/prevent, and respond to ransomware incidents. PREPARING FOR CYBER INCIDENTS Review the security posture of third-party vendors and those interconnected with your organization. Ensure all connections between third-party vendors and outside software or hardware are monitored and reviewed for suspicious activity.Implement listing policies for applications and remote access that only allow systems to execute known and permitted programsunder an established security policy.Document and monitor external remote connections. Organizations should document approved solutions for remote management and maintenance, and immediately investigate if an unapproved solution is installed on a workstation.Implement a recovery planto maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive, storage device, the cloud). IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT Require all accountswith password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and domain admin accounts) to comply withNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardsfor developing and managing password policies.Use longer passwords consisting of at least 8 characters and no more than 64 characters in length.Store passwords in hashed format using industry-recognized password managers.Add password user “salts” to shared login credentials.Avoid reusing passwords.Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts.Disable password “hints.”Refrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year unless a password is known or suspected to be compromised.Note: NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users developing password “patterns” cyber criminals can easily decipher.Require administrator credentials to install software.Require phishing-resistant multifactor authenticationfor all services to the extent possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems.Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directoriesfor new and/or unrecognized accounts.Audit user accountswith administrative privileges and configure access controls according to the principle of least privilege.Implement time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher.

Privilege escalation and lateral movement often depend on software utilities running from the command line. If threat actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or moving laterally.Ensure devices are properly configured and that security features are enabled.Restrict Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol within the network to only access necessary servers and remove or disable outdated versions of SMB(i.e., SMB version 1). Threat actors use SMB to propagate malware across organizations.

Prioritize patching VPN servers, remote access software, virtual machine software, andknown exploited vulnerabilities. Consider leveraging a centralized patch management system to automate and expedite the process.Require phishing-resistant MFA for as many services as possible—particularly for webmail, VPNs, accounts that access critical systems, and privileged accounts that manage backups.If you use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), secure and monitor it.Limit access to resources over internal networks, especially by restricting RDP and using virtual desktop infrastructure. After assessing risks, if RDP is deemed operationally necessary, restrict the originating sources, and require multifactor authentication (MFA) to mitigate credential theft and reuse. If RDP must be available externally, use a virtual private network (VPN), virtual desktop infrastructure, or other means to authenticate and secure the connection before allowing RDP to connect to internal devices. Monitor remote access/RDP logs, enforce account lockouts after a specified number of attempts to block brute force campaigns, log RDP login attempts, and disable unused remote access/RDP ports.Ensure devices are properly configured and that security features are enabled. Disable ports and protocols that are not being used for business purposes (e.g., RDP Transmission Control Protocol Port 3389).Turn off SSH and other network device management interfaces such as Telnet, Winbox, and HTTP for wide area networks (WANs) and secure with strong passwords and encryption when enabled.Implement and enforce multi-layer network segmentation with the most critical communications and data resting on the most secure and reliable layer.Limit access to data by deploying public key infrastructure and digital certificates to authenticate connections with the network, Internet of Things (IoT) medical devices, and the electronic health record system, as well as to ensure data packages are not manipulated while in transit from man-in-the-middle attacks.Use standard user accounts on internal systems instead of administrative accounts, which allow for overarching administrative system privileges and do not ensure least privilege.Secure PII/PHI at collection points and encrypt the data at rest and in transit by using technologies such as Transport Layer Security (TPS). Only store personal patient data on internal systems that are protected by firewalls, and ensure extensive backups are available if data is ever compromised.Protect stored data by masking the permanent account number (PAN) when it is displayed and rendering it unreadable when it is stored—through cryptography, for example.Secure the collection, storage, and processing practices for PII and PHI, per regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Implementing HIPAA security measures can prevent the introduction of malware on the system.Use monitoring tools to observe whether IoT devices are behaving erratically due to a compromise.Create and regularly review internal policies that regulate the collection, storage, access, and monitoring of PII/PHI.In addition, the FBI, CISA, and HHS urge all organizations, including HPH Sector organizations, to apply the following recommendations to prepare for, mitigate/prevent, and respond to ransomware incidents.

It is awaiting reanalysis, which may result in further changes to the information provided. A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. A malicious actor could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration ""require all denied,"" these requests can succeed. Enabling CGI scripts for these aliased paths could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 is incomplete (see CVE-2021-42013). Recommended Mitigations Apply update or patch. Detection Methods Commercially available scanners can detect CVE.

https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-277a,"Mitigations Mitigation recommendations are usually longer-term efforts that take place before a compromise as part of risk management efforts, or after the threat actors have been evicted from the environment and the immediate response actions are complete. While some may be tailored to the TTPs used by the threat actor, recovery recommendations are largely general best practices and industry standards aimed at bolstering overall cybersecurity posture."
https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-265a,"Mitigations The complexity of balancing network security with performance, features, ease-of-use, and availability can be overwhelming for owner/operators. This is especially true where system tools and scripts enable ease-of-use and increase availability or functionality of the control network; and when equipment vendors require remote access for warranty     compliance, service obligations, and financial/billing functionality. However, with the increase in targeting of OT/ICS by malicious actors, owner/operators should be more cognizant of the risks when making these balancing decisions. Owner/operators should also carefully consider what information about their systems needs to be publicly available and determine if each external connection is truly needed. [1] System owners and operators cannot prevent a malicious actor from targeting their systems. Understanding that being targeted is not an “if” but a “when” is essential context for making ICS security decisions. By assuming that the system is being targeted and predicting the effects that a malicious actor would intend to cause, owner/operators can employ and prioritize mitigation actions. However, the variety of available security solutions can also be intimidating, resulting in choice paralysis. In the midst of so many options, owner/operators may be unable to incorporate simple security and administrative strategies that could mitigate many of the common and realistic threats. Fortunately, owner/operators can apply a few straightforward ICS security best practices to counter adversary TTPs."
https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-257a,"Mitigations The authoring agencies urge network defenders to prepare for and mitigate potential cyber threats immediately by implementing the mitigations below. IMPLEMENT AND ENFORCE BACKUP AND RESTORATION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Maintain offline (i.e., physically disconnected) backups of data, and regularly test backup and restoration.These practices safeguard an organization’s continuity of operations or at least minimize potential downtime from a ransomware or other destructive data incident and protect against data losses.Ensure all backup data is encrypted,immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization’s data infrastructure.Activate BitLocker on all networksand securely back up BitLocker keys with Microsoft and with an independent offline backup.Create, maintain, and exercise a basic cyber incident response plan that includes response procedures for a ransom incident.Implement a recovery planto maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, secure location (e.g., hard drive, storage device, the cloud). Ensure all backup data is encrypted,immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization’s data infrastructure. PATCH AND UPDATE SYSTEMS U.S. federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) government and critical infrastructure organizations: Implement freeCISA Cyber Hygiene Services Vulnerability Scanningto enable continuous scans of public, static IPs for accessible services and vulnerabilities.Install updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as updates/patches are released.

Prevent any attempts to install or run this program and its associated files. IMPLEMENT NETWORK SEGMENTATION Implement network segmentation to restrict a malicious threat actor’s lateral movement. SECURE USER ACCOUNTS Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls under the principles of least privilege and separation of duties.Require administrator credentials to install software. IMPLEMENT MULTIFACTOR AUTHENTICATION Use multifactor authentication where possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks (VPNs), accounts that access critical systems, and privileged accounts that manage backups. USE STRONG PASSWORDS Require all accounts with password logins to have strong, unique passwords. See CISA TipChoosing and Protecting Passwordsand National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)Special Publication 800-63B: Digital Identity Guidelinesfor more information. SECURE AND MONITOR RDP AND OTHER POTENTIALLY RISKY SERVICES If you use RDP, restrict it to limit access to resources over internal networks. After assessing risks, if your organization deems RDP operationally necessary, restrict the originating sources, and require MFA to mitigate credential theft and reuse. If RDP must be available externally, use a VPN, virtual desktop infrastructure, or other means to authenticate and secure the connection before allowing RDP to connect to internal devices.Disable unused remote access/RDP ports.Monitor remote access/RDP logs, enforce account lockouts after a specified number of attempts (to block brute force campaigns), and log RDP login attempts.

https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-249a,"Mitigations The FBI and CISA recommend organizations, particularly the education sector, establish and maintain strong liaison relationships with the FBI Field Office in their region and their regional CISA Cybersecurity Advisor. The location and contact information for FBI Field Offices and CISA Regional Offices can be located atwww.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-officesandwww.cisa.gov/cisa-regions, respectively. Through these partnerships, the FBI and CISA can assist with identifying vulnerabilities to academia and mitigating potential threat activity. The FBI and CISA further recommend that academic entities review and, if needed, update incident response and communication plans that list actions an organization will take if impacted by a cyber incident. The FBI, CISA, and the MS-ISAC recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the risk of compromise by Vice Society actors: Preparing for Cyber Incidents Maintain offline backups of data,and regularly maintain backup and restoration.  By instituting this practice, the organization ensures they will not be severely interrupted, and/or only have irretrievable data.Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable(i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization’s data infrastructure. Ensure your backup data is not already infected.Review the security posture of third-party vendors and those interconnected with your organization.Ensure all connections between third-party vendors and outside software or hardware are monitored and reviewed for suspicious activity.Implement listing policies for applications and remote access that only allow systems to execute known and permitted programsunder an established security policy.Document and monitor external remote connections.Organizations should document approved solutions for remote management and maintenance, and immediately investigate if an unapproved solution is installed on a workstation.Implement a recovery planto maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive, storage device, the cloud). Identity and Access Management Require all accountswith password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and domain admin accounts)to complywithNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardsfor developing and managing password policies.Use longer passwords consisting of at least 8 characters and no more than 64 characters in length;Store passwords in hashed format using industry-recognized password managers;Add password user “salts” to shared login credentials;Avoid reusing passwords;Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts;Disable password “hints”;Refrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year unless a password is known or suspected to be compromised.Note:NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users developing password “patterns” cyber criminals can easily decipher.Require administrator credentials to install software.Require phishing-resistant multifactor authenticationfor all services to the extent possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems.Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directoriesfor new and/or unrecognized accounts.Audit user accountswith administrative privileges and configure access controls according to the principle of least privilege.Implement time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher.For example, the Just-in-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the Zero Trust model). This is a process where a network-wide policy is set in place to automatically disable admin accounts at the Active Directory level when the account is not in direct need.

https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-216a,"Mitigations Below are the steps that CISA and ACSC recommend organizations take to improve their cybersecurity posture based on known adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). CISA and ACSC urge critical infrastructure organizations to prepare for and mitigate potential cyber threats immediately by (1) updating software, (2) enforcing MFA, (3) securing and monitoring RDP and other potentially risky services, (4) making offline backups of your data, and (5) providing end-user awareness and training. Update software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware, on IT network assets.

Do not allow passwords to be used across multiple accounts or stored on a system to which an adversary may have access. Additionally, ACSC has issued guidance on implementing multifactor authentication for hardening authentication systems.If you use RDP and/or other potentially risky services, secure and monitor them closely. RDP exploitation is one of the top initial infection vectors for ransomware, and risky services, including RDP, can allow unauthorized access to your session using an on-path attacker.Limit access to resources over internal networks, especially by restricting RDP and using virtual desktop infrastructure. After assessing risks, if RDP is deemed operationally necessary, restrict the originating sources, and require MFA to mitigate credential theft and reuse. If RDP must be available externally, use a virtual private network (VPN) or other means to authenticate and secure the connection before allowing RDP to connect to internal devices. Monitor remote access/RDP logs, enforce account lockouts after a specified number of attempts to block brute force attempts, log RDP login attempts, and disable unused remote access/RDP ports.Ensure devices are properly configured and that security features are enabled. Disable ports and protocols that are not being used for a business purpose (e.g., RDP Transmission Control Protocol Port 3389).Maintain offline (i.e., physically disconnected) backups of data. Backup procedures should be conducted on a frequent, regular basis (at a minimum every 90 days). Regularly test backup procedures and ensure that backups are isolated from network connections that could enable the spread of malware.Ensure the backup keys are kept offline as well, to prevent them being encrypted in a ransomware incident.Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization’s data infrastructure with a particular focus on key data assets.Provide end-user awareness and trainingto help prevent successful targeted social engineering and spearphishing campaigns. Phishing is one of the top infection vectors for ransomware.Ensure that employees are aware of potential cyber threats and delivery methods.Ensure that employees are aware of what to do and whom to contact when they receive a suspected phishing email or suspect a cyber incident.

https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-108a,"Mitigations North Korean state-sponsored cyber actors use a full array of tactics and techniques to exploit computer networks of interest, acquire sensitive cryptocurrency-intellectual property, and gain financial assets. The U.S. government recommends implementing mitigations to protect critical infrastructure organizations as well as financial sector organizations in the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency industry. Apply defense-in-depth security strategy. Apply security principles—such as least access models and defense-in-depth—to user and application privileges to help prevent exploitation attempts from being successful. Use network segmentation to separate networks into zones based on roles and requirements. Separate network zones can help prevent lateral movement throughout the organization and limit the attack surface. See NSA’sTop Ten Cybersecurity Mitigation Strategiesfor strategies enterprise organizations should use to build a defense-in-depth security posture.Implement patch management. Initial and follow-on exploitation involves leveraging common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) to gain access to a networked environment. Organizations should have a timely vulnerability and patch management program in place to mitigate exposure to critical CVEs. Prioritize patching of internet-facing devices and monitored accordingly for any malicious logic attacks.Enforce credential requirements and multifactor authentication. North Korean malicious cyber actors continuously target user credentials, email, social media, and private business accounts. Organizations should ensure users change passwords regularly to reduce the impact of password spraying and other brute force techniques. The U.S. government recommends organizations implement and enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) to reduce the risk of credential theft. Be aware ofMFA interception techniques for some MFA implementationsand monitor for anomalous logins.Educate users on social engineering on social media and spearphishing. North Korean actors rely heavily on social engineering, leveraging email and social media platforms to build trust and send malicious documents to unsuspecting users. A cybersecurity aware workforce is one of the best defenses against social engineering techniques like phishing. User training should include how to identify social engineering techniques and awareness to only open links and attachments from trusted senders.Implement email and domain mitigations. Maintain awareness of themed emails surrounding current events. Malicious cyber actors use current events as lure for potential victims as observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Organizations should have a robust domain security solution that includes leveraging reputation checks and closely monitoring or blocking newly registered domains (NRDs) in enterprise traffic. NRDs are commonly established by threat actors prior to malicious engagement.HTML and email scanning. Organizations should disable HTML from being used in emails and scan email attachments. Embedded scripts may be hard for an antivirus product to detect if they are fragmented. An additional malware scanning interface product can be integrated to combine potentially malicious payloads and send the payload to the primary antivirus product. Hyperlinks in emails should also be scanned and opened with precautionary measures to reduce the likelihood of a user clicking on a malicious link.Endpoint protection. Although network security is critical, devices mobility often means traveling and connecting to multiple different networks that offer varying levels of security. To reduce the risk of introducing exposed hosts to critical networks, organizations should ensure mobile devices have installed security suites to detect and mitigate malware.Enforce application security. Application allowlisting enables the organization to monitor programs and only allow those on the approved allowlist to execute. Allowlisting helps to stop the initial attack, even if the user clicks a malicious link or opens a malicious attachment. Implement baseline rule sets, such as NSA’sLimiting Location Data Exposureguidance, to block execution of unauthorized or malicious programs.Disable macros in office products. Macros are a common method for executing code through an attached office document. Some office products allow for the disabling of macros that originate from outside of the organization, providing a hybrid approach when the organization depends on the legitimate use of macros.Windows specific settings can be configured to block internet-originated macros from running. This can be done in the Group Policy Administrative Templates for each of the associated Office products (specifically Word, Excel and PowerPoint). Other productivity software, such as LibreOffice and OpenOffice, can be configured to set the Macro Security Level.Be aware of third-party downloads—especially cryptocurrency applications. North Korean actors have been increasingly active with currency generation operations. Users should always verify file downloads and ensure the source is from a reputable or primary (preferred) source and not from a third-party vendor. Malicious cyber actors have continuously demonstrated the ability to trojanize applications and gain a foothold on host devices.Create an incident response plan to respond to possible cyber intrusions. The plan should include reporting incidents to both the FBI and CISA—quick reporting can reduce the severity of incidents and provide valuable information to investigators. Contact information can be found below. HTML and email scanning. Organizations should disable HTML from being used in emails and scan email attachments. Embedded scripts may be hard for an antivirus product to detect if they are fragmented. An additional malware scanning interface product can be integrated to combine potentially malicious payloads and send the payload to the primary antivirus product. Hyperlinks in emails should also be scanned and opened with precautionary measures to reduce the likelihood of a user clicking on a malicious link. Disable macros in office products.

Perform audits or scans of systems, permissions, insecure software, insecure configurations, etc., to identify potential weaknesses. Make configuration changes related to the operating system or a common feature of the operating system that result in system hardening against techniques. Enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) by requiring users to provide two or more pieces of information (such as username and password plus a token, e.g., a physical smart card or token generator) to authenticate to a system. Use network appliances to filter ingress or egress traffic and perform protocol-based filtering. Configure software on endpoints to filter network traffic. Architect sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions, or resources. Use physical and logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially sensitive systems and information. Use a demilitarized zone (DMZ) to contain any internet-facing services that should not be exposed from the internal network. Prevent access to file shares, remote access to systems, and unnecessary services. Mechanisms to limit access may include use of network concentrators, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) gateways, etc. Block execution of code on a system through application control, and/or script blocking. INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT CISA, the FBI, and DOE recommend Energy Sector and other critical infrastructure organizations implement the following mitigations to harden their ICS/OT environment. Implement and ensure robust network segmentation between IT and ICS networks to limit the ability of cyber threat actors to move laterally to ICS networks if the IT network is compromised.Implement a network topology for ICS that has multiple layers, with the most critical communications occurring in the most secure and reliable layer. For more information refer to National Institute of Standard and TechnologySpecial Publication 800-82: Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security. Further segmentation should be applied to portions of the network that are reliant on one another by functionality. Figure 5 on page 26 of theCISA ICS Defense in Depth Strategydocument describes this architecture.Use one-way communication diodes to prevent external access, whenever possible.Set up DMZs to create a physical and logical subnetwork that acts as an intermediary for connected security devices to avoid exposure.Employ reliable network security protocols and services where feasible.Consider using virtual local area networks (VLANs) for additional network segmentation, for example, by placing all printers in separate, dedicated VLANs and restricting users’ direct printer access. This same principle can be applied to segmentation of portions of the process for which devices are used. As an example, systems that are only involved in the creation of one component within an assembly line that is not directly related to another component can be on separate VLANs, which allows for identification of any unexpected communication, as well as segmentation against potential risk exposure on a larger scale.Implement perimeter security between network segments to limit the ability of cyber threat actors to move laterally.Control traffic between network segments by using firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDSs), and rules for filtering traffic on routers and switches.Implement network monitoring at key chokepoints—including egress points to the internet, between network segments, core switch locations—and at key assets or services (e.g., remote access services).Configure an IDS to create alarms for any ICS traffic outside normal operations (after establishing a baseline of normal operations and network traffic).Configure security incident and event monitoring to monitor, analyze, and correlate event logs from across the ICS network to identify intrusion attempts.

Update all software. Use a risk-based assessment strategy to determine which ICS networks, assets, and zones should participate in the patch management program.Test all patches in out-of-band testing environments before implementation into production environments.Implement application allow listing on human machine interfaces and engineering workstations.Harden software configuration on field devices, including tablets and smartphones.Replace all end-of-life software and hardware devices.Disable unused ports and services on ICS devices (after testing to ensure this will not affect ICS operation).Restrict and manage remote access software. Enforce MFA for remote access to ICS networks.Configure encryption and security for network protocols within the ICS environment.Do not allow vendors to connect their devices to the ICS network. Use of a compromised device could introduce malware.Disallow any devices that do not live solely on the ICS environment from communicating on the platform. ‘Transient devices’ provide risk exposure to the ICS environment from malicious activity in the IT or other environments to which they connect.Maintain an ICS asset inventory of all hardware, software, and supporting infrastructure technologies.Maintain robust host logging on critical devices within the ICS environment, such as jump boxes, domain controllers, repository servers, etc. These logs should be aggregated into a centralized log server for review.Ensure robust physical security is in place to prevent unauthorized personal from accessing controlled spaces that house ICS equipment.Regularly test manual controls so that critical functions can be kept running if ICS/OT networks need to be taken offline."
https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-076a,"Mitigations CISA and FBI strongly encourages critical infrastructure organizations and other organizations that are either SATCOM network providers or customers to review and implement the following mitigations: MITIGATIONS FOR SATCOM NETWORK PROVIDERS Put in placeadditional monitoring at ingress and egress pointsto SATCOM equipment to look for anomalous traffic, such as:The presence of insecure remote access tools—such as Teletype Network Protocol (Telnet), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Secure Shell Protocol (SSH), Secure Copy Protocol (SCP), and Virtual Network Computing (VNC)—facilitating communications to and from SATCOM terminals.Network traffic from SATCOM networks to other unexpected network segments.Unauthorized use of local or backup accounts within SATCOM networks.Unexpected SATCOM terminal to SATCOM terminal traffic.Network traffic from the internet to closed group SATCOM networks.Brute force login attempts over SATCOM network segments.See the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)Annual Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community, February 2022for specific state-sponsored cyber threat activity relating to SATCOM networks.

https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-074a,"Mitigations The FBI and CISA recommend organizations remain cognizant of the threat of state-sponsored cyber actors exploiting default MFA protocols and exfiltrating sensitive information. Organizations should: Enforce MFA for all users, without exception. Before implementing, organizations should review configuration policies to protect against “fail open” and re-enrollment scenarios.Implement time-out and lock-out features in response to repeated failed login attempts.Ensure inactive accounts are disabled uniformly across the Active Directory, MFA systems etc.Update software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware on IT network assets in a timely manner. Prioritize patchingknown exploited vulnerabilities, especially critical and high vulnerabilities that allow for remote code execution or denial-of-service on internet-facing equipment.Require all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and domain admin accounts) to have strong, unique passwords. Passwords should not be reused across multiple accounts or stored on the system where an adversary may have access.Continuously monitor network logs for suspicious activity and unauthorized or unusual login attempts.Implement security alerting policies for all changes to security-enabled accounts/groups, and alert on suspicious process creation events (ntdsutil,rar,regedit, etc.). Note:If a domain controller compromise is suspected, a domain-wide password reset—including service accounts, Microsoft 365 (M365) synchronization accounts, andkrbtgt—will be necessary to remove the actors’ access. (For more information, seehttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/87978/reset-krbtgt-password.html). Consider soliciting support from a third-party IT organization to provide subject matter expertise, ensure the actor is eradicated from the network, and avoid residual issues that could enable follow-on exploitation. FBI and CISA also recommend organizations implement the recommendations listed below to further reduce the risk of malicious cyber activity. SECURITY BEST PRACTICES Deploy Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS), enforce Server Message Block (SMB) Signing, restrict Administrative privileges (local admin users, groups, etc.), and review sensitive materials on domain controller’sSYSVOLshare.Enable increased logging policies, enforce PowerShell logging, and ensure antivirus/endpoint detection and response (EDR) are deployed to all endpoints and enabled.Routinely verify no unauthorized system modifications, such as additional accounts and Secure Shell (SSH) keys, have occurred to help detect a compromise. To detect these modifications, administrators can use file integrity monitoring software that alerts an administrator or blocks unauthorized changes on the system. NETWORK BEST PRACTICES Monitor remote access/ RDP logs and disable unused remote access/RDP ports.Deny atypical inbound activity from known anonymization services, to include commercial VPN services and The Onion Router (TOR).Implement listing policies for applications and remote access that only allow systems to execute known and permitted programs under an established security policy.Regularly audit administrative user accounts and configure access control under the concept of least privilege.Regularly audit logs to ensure new accounts are legitimate users.Scan networks for open and listening ports and mediate those that are unnecessary.Maintain historical network activity logs for at least 180 days, in case of a suspected compromise.Identify and create offline backups for critical assets.Implement network segmentation.Automatically update anti-virus and anti-malware solutions and conduct regular virus and malware scans. REMOTE WORK ENVIRONMENT BEST PRACTICES With an increase in remote work environments and the use of VPN services, the FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the following best practices to improve network security: Regularly update VPNs, network infrastructure devices, and devices used for remote work environments with the latest software patches and security configurations.When possible, implement multi-factor authentication on all VPN connections. Physical security tokens are the most secure form of MFA, followed by authenticator applications. When MFA is unavailable, require employees engaging in remote work to use strong passwords.Monitor network traffic for unapproved and unexpected protocols.Reduce potential attack surfaces by discontinuing unused VPN servers that may be used as a point of entry for attackers. USER AWARENESS BEST PRACTICES Cyber actors frequently use unsophisticated methods to gain initial access, which can often be mitigated by stronger employee awareness of indicators of malicious activity. The FBI and CISA recommend the following best practices to improve employee operations security when conducting business: Provide end-user awareness and training. To help prevent targeted social engineering and spearphishing scams, ensure that employees and stakeholders are aware of potential cyber threats and delivery methods. Also, provide users with training on information security principles and techniques.Inform employees of the risks associated with posting detailed career information to social or professional networking sites.Ensure that employees are aware of what to do and whom to contact when they see suspicious activity or suspect a cyberattack, to help quickly and efficiently identify threats and employ mitigation strategies."
https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-057a,"Mitigations BEST PRACTICES FOR HANDLING DESTRUCTIVE MALWARE As previously noted above, destructive malware can present a direct threat to an organization’s daily operations, impacting the availability of critical assets and data. Organizations should increase vigilance and evaluate their capabilities, encompassing planning, preparation, detection, and response, for such an event. This section is focused on the threat of malware using enterprise-scale distributed propagation methods and provides recommended guidance and considerations for an organization to address as part of their network architecture, security baseline, continuous monitoring, and incident response practices. CISA and the FBI urge all organizations to implement the following recommendations to increase their cyber resilience against this threat. POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION VECTORS Destructive malware may use popular communication tools to spread, including worms sent through email and instant messages, Trojan horses dropped from websites, and virus-infected files downloaded from peer-to-peer connections. Malware seeks to exploit existing vulnerabilities on systems for quiet and easy access. The malware has the capability to target a large scope of systems and can execute across multiple systems throughout a network. As a result, it is important for organizations to assess their environment for atypical channels for malware delivery and/or propagation throughout their systems. Systems to assess include: Enterprise applications – particularly those that have the capability to directly interface with and impact multiple hosts and endpoints. Common examples include:Patch management systems,Asset management systems,Remote assistance software (typically used by the corporate help desk),Antivirus (AV) software,Systems assigned to system and network administrative personnel,Centralized backup servers, andCentralized file shares. Patch management systems,Asset management systems,Remote assistance software (typically used by the corporate help desk),Antivirus (AV) software,Systems assigned to system and network administrative personnel,Centralized backup servers, andCentralized file shares. While not only applicable to malware, threat actors could compromise additional resources to impact the availability of critical data and applications. Common examples include: Centralized storage devicesPotential risk – direct access to partitions and data warehouses.Network devicesPotential risk – capability to inject false routes within the routing table, delete specific routes from the routing table, remove/modify, configuration attributes, or destroy firmware or system binaries—which could isolate or degrade availability of critical network resources.

Potential risk – capability to inject false routes within the routing table, delete specific routes from the routing table, remove/modify, configuration attributes, or destroy firmware or system binaries—which could isolate or degrade availability of critical network resources. BEST PRACTICES AND PLANNING STRATEGIES Common strategies can be followed to strengthen an organization’s resilience against destructive malware. Targeted assessment and enforcement of best practices should be employed for enterprise components susceptible to destructive malware. Ensure proper network segmentation.Ensure that network-based access control lists (ACLs) are configured to permit server-to-host and host-to-host connectivity via the minimum scope of ports and protocols and that directional flows for connectivity are represented appropriately.Communications flow paths should be fully defined, documented, and authorized.Increase awareness of systems that can be used as a gateway to pivot (lateral movement) or directly connect to additional endpoints throughout the enterprise.Ensure that these systems are contained within restrictive Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs), with additional segmentation and network access controls.Ensure that centralized network and storage devices’ management interfaces reside on restrictive VLANs.Layered access control, andDevice-level access control enforcement – restricting access from only pre-defined VLANs and trusted IP ranges.

Continually review network device configurations and rule sets to ensure that communications flows are restricted to the authorized subset of rules. When deploying patches or AV signatures throughout an enterprise, stage the distributions to include a specific grouping of systems (staggered over a pre-defined period).This action can minimize the overall impact in the event that an enterprise patch management or AV system is leveraged as a distribution vector for a malicious payload.Monitor and assess the integrity of patches and AV signatures that are distributed throughout the enterprise.Ensure updates are received only from trusted sources,Perform file and data integrity checks, andMonitor and audit – as related to the data that is distributed from an enterprise application.

Ensure robust vulnerability management and patching practices are in place.CISA maintainsa living catalog of known exploited vulnerabilitiesthat carry significant risk to federal agencies as well as public and private sectors entities. In addition to thoroughly testing and implementing vendor patches in a timely—and, if possible, automated— manner, organizations should ensure patching of the vulnerabilities CISA includes in this catalog.Ensure that the underlying operating system (OS) and dependencies (e.g., Internet Information Services [IIS], Apache, Structured Query Language [SQL]) supporting an application are configured and hardened based upon industry-standard best practice recommendations. Implement application-level security controls based on best practice guidance provided by the vendor. Common recommendations include:Use role-based access control,Prevent end-user capabilities to bypass application-level security controls,For example, do not allow users to disable AV on local workstations.Remove, or disable unnecessary or unused features or packages, andImplement robust application logging and auditing.

The overall output of a BIA will provide an organization with two key components (as related to critical mission/business operations): Characterization and classification of system components, andInterdependencies. Based upon the identification of an organization’s mission critical assets (and their associated interdependencies), in the event that an organization is impacted by destructive malware, recovery and reconstitution efforts should be considered. To plan for this scenario, an organization should address the availability and accessibility for the following resources (and should include the scope of these items within incident response exercises and scenarios): Comprehensive inventory of all mission critical systems and applications:Versioning information,System/application dependencies,System partitioning/storage configuration and connectivity, andAsset owners/points of contact.Contact information for all essential personnel within the organization,Secure communications channel for recovery teams,Contact information for external organizational-dependent resources:Communication providers,Vendors (hardware/software), andOutreach partners/external stakeholdersService contract numbers – for engaging vendor support,Organizational procurement points of contact,Optical disc image (ISO)/image files for baseline restoration of critical systems and applications:OS installation media,Service packs/patches,Firmware, andApplication software installation packages.Licensing/activation keys for OS and dependent applications,Enterprise network topology and architecture diagrams,System and application documentation,Hard copies of operational checklists and playbooks,System and application configuration backup files,Data backup files (full/differential),System and application security baseline and hardening checklists/guidelines, andSystem and application integrity test and acceptance checklists.

Communication providers,Vendors (hardware/software), andOutreach partners/external stakeholders OS installation media,Service packs/patches,Firmware, andApplication software installation packages. Victims of a destructive malware attacks should immediately focus on containment to reduce the scope of affected systems. Strategies for containment include: Determining a vector common to all systems experiencing anomalous behavior (or having been rendered unavailable)—from which a malicious payload could have been delivered:Centralized enterprise application,Centralized file share (for which the identified systems were mapped or had access),Privileged user account common to the identified systems,Network segment or boundary, andCommon Domain Name System (DNS) server for name resolution.Based upon the determination of a likely distribution vector, additional mitigation controls can be enforced to further minimize impact:Implement network-based ACLs to deny the identified application(s) the capability to directly communicate with additional systems,Provides an immediate capability to isolate and sandbox specific systems or resources.Implement null network routes for specific IP addresses (or IP ranges) from which the payload may be distributed,An organization’s internal DNS can also be leveraged for this task, as a null pointer record could be added within a DNS zone for an identified server or application.Readily disable access for suspected user or service account(s),For suspect file shares (which may be hosting the infection vector), remove access or disable the share path from being accessed by additional systems, andBe prepared to, if necessary, reset all passwords and tickets within directories (e.g., changing golden/silver tickets).

https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-055a,"Mitigations PROTECTIVE CONTROLS AND ARCHITECTURE Deploy application control software to limit the applications and executable code that can be run by users.Email attachments and files downloaded via links in emails often contain executable code. IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT Use multifactor authentication where possible,particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems.Limit the use of administrator privileges.Users who browse the internet, use email, and execute code with administrator privileges make for excellent spearphishing targets because their system—once infected—enables attackers to move laterally across the network, gain additional accesses, and access highly sensitive information. PHISHING PROTECTION Enable antivirus and anti-malware software and update signature definitions in a timely manner.Well-maintained antivirus software may prevent use of commonly deployed attacker tools that are delivered via spearphishing.Be suspicious of unsolicited contact via email or social media from any individual you do not know personally.Do not click on hyperlinks or open attachments in these communications.Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization and disabling hyperlinks in received emails.Train users through awareness and simulations to recognize and report phishing and social engineering attempts.Identify and suspend access of user accounts exhibiting unusual activity.Adopt threat reputation services at the network device, operating system, application, and email service levels.Reputation services can be used to detect or prevent low-reputation email addresses, files, URLs, and IP addresses used in spearphishing attacks.

https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-047a,"Mitigations The FBI, NSA, and CISA encourage all CDCs, with or without evidence of compromise, to apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of compromise by this threat actor. While these mitigations are not intended to be all-encompassing, they address common TTPs observed in these intrusions and will help to mitigate against common malicious activity. IMPLEMENT CREDENTIAL HARDENING Enable multifactor authentication (MFA)for all users, without exception. Subsequent authentication may not require MFA, enabling the possibility to bypass MFA by reusing single factor authentication assertions (e.g., Kerberos authentication). Reducing the lifetime of assertions will cause account re-validation of their MFA requirements.[6] Service accounts should not use MFA. Automation and platform features (e.g., Group Managed Service Accounts, gMSA) can provide automatic and periodic complex password management for service accounts, reducing the threat surface against single factor authentication assertions.[7] Require accounts to have strong, unique passwords.Passwords should not be reused across multiple accounts or stored on the system where an adversary may have access.Enable password management functions, such as Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS), for local administrative accounts. This will reduce the burden of users managing passwords and encourage them to have strong passwords. Implement time-out and lock-out featuresin response to repeated failed login attempts.Configure time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher.For example, the Just-In-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the Zero Trust model). This is a process where a network-wide policy is set in place to automatically disable administrator accounts at the AD level when the account is not in direct need. When the account is needed, individual users submit their requests through an automated process that enables access to a system but only for a set timeframe to support task completion. Use virtualization solutions on modern hardware and softwareto ensure credentials are securely stored, and protect credentials via capabilities, such as Windows Defender Credential Guard (CredGuard) and Trusted Platform Module (TPM).[8] Protecting domain credentials with CredGuard requires configuration and has limitations in protecting other types of credentials (e.g., WDigest and local accounts).[9][10] CredGuard uses TPMs to protect stored credentials. TPMs function as a system integrity observer and trust anchor ensuring the integrity of the boot sequence and mechanisms (e.g., UEFI Secure Boot). Installation of Windows 11 requires TPM v2.0.[11] Disabling WDigest and rolling expiring NTLM secrets in smartcards will further protect other credentials not protected by CredGuard.[12][13] ESTABLISH CENTRALIZED LOG MANAGEMENT Create a centralized log management system.Centralized logging applications allow network defenders to look for anomalous activity, such as out-of-place communications between devices or unaccountable login failures, in the network environment.Forward all logs to a SIEM tool.Ensure logs are searchable.Retain critical and historic network activity logs for a minimum of 180 days.If using M365, enable Unified Audit Log (UAL)—M365’s logging capability—which contains events from Exchange Online, SharePoint online, OneDrive, Azure AD, Microsoft Teams, PowerBI, and other M365 services.Correlate logs, including M365 logs, from network and host security devices.This correlation will help with detecting anomalous activity in the network environment and connecting it with potential anomalous activity in M365. Forward all logs to a SIEM tool.Ensure logs are searchable.Retain critical and historic network activity logs for a minimum of 180 days. In addition to setting up centralized logging, organizations should: Ensure PowerShell logging is turned on.Threat actors often use PowerShell to hide their malicious activities.[14]Update PowerShell instances to version 5.0 or laterand uninstall all earlier versions of PowerShell. Logs from prior versions are either non-existent or do not record enough detail to aid in enterprise monitoring and incident response activities.Confirm PowerShell 5.0 instances have module, script block, and transcription loggingenabled.Monitor remote access/Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) logsand disable unused remote access/RDP ports. INITIATE A SOFTWARE AND PATCH MANAGEMENT PROGRAM Consider using a centralized patch management system.Failure to deploy software patches in a timely manner makes an organization a target of opportunity, increasing its risk of compromise. Organizations can ensure timely patching of software vulnerabilities by implementing an enterprise-wide software and patch management program.[15]If an organization is unable to update all software shortly after a patch is released,prioritize patches for CVEs that are already knownto be exploited or that would be accessible to the largest number of potential adversaries (such as internet-facing systems).Subscribe toCISA cybersecurity notifications and advisoriesto keep up with known exploited vulnerabilities, security updates, and threats. This will assist organizations in maintaining situational awareness of critical software vulnerabilities and, if applicable, associated exploitation.Sign up for CISA’scyber hygiene services, including vulnerability scanning, to help reduce exposure to threats. CISA’s vulnerability scanning service evaluates external network presence by executing continuous scans of public, static IPs for accessible services and vulnerabilities. If an organization is unable to update all software shortly after a patch is released,prioritize patches for CVEs that are already knownto be exploited or that would be accessible to the largest number of potential adversaries (such as internet-facing systems).Subscribe toCISA cybersecurity notifications and advisoriesto keep up with known exploited vulnerabilities, security updates, and threats. This will assist organizations in maintaining situational awareness of critical software vulnerabilities and, if applicable, associated exploitation. EMPLOY ANTIVIRUS PROGRAMS Ensure that antivirus applications are installed on all organizations’ computersand are configured to prevent spyware, adware, and malware as part of the operating system security baseline.Keep virus definitions up to date.Regularly monitor antivirus scans. USE ENDPOINT DETECTION AND RESPONSE TOOLS Utilize endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools.These tools allow a high degree of visibility into the security status of endpoints and can be an effective defense against threat actors. EDR tools are particularly useful for detecting lateral movement, as they have insight into common and uncommon network connections for each host. MAINTAIN RIGOROUS CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS Audit configuration management programsto ensure they can track and mitigate emerging threats. Review system configurations for misconfigurations and security weaknesses. Having a robust configuration program hinders sophisticated threat operations by limiting the effectiveness of opportunistic attacks.[16] ENFORCE THE PRINCIPLE OF LEAST PRIVILEGE Apply the principle of least privilege.Administrator accounts should have the minimum permissions they need to do their tasks. This can reduce the impact if an administrator account is compromised.For M365, assign administrator roles to role-based access control (RBAC)to implement the principle of least privilege. Given its high level of default privilege, you should only use the Global Administrator account when absolutely necessary. Using Azure AD’s numerous other built-in administrator roles instead of the Global Administrator account can limit assigning unnecessary privileges.Note:refer to the Microsoft documentation,Azure AD built-in roles, for more information about Azure AD.Remove privileges not expressly required by an account’s function or role.Ensure there are unique and distinct administrative accountsfor each set of administrative tasks.Create non-privileged accounts for privileged users,and ensure they use the non- privileged accounts for all non-privileged access (e.g., web browsing, email access).Reduce the number of domain and enterprise administrator accounts,and remove all accounts that are unnecessary.Regularly audit administrative user accounts.Regularly audit logs to ensure new accounts are legitimate users.Institute a group policy that disables remote interactive logins,and use Domain Protected Users Group. To assist with identifying suspicious behavior with administrative accounts: Create privileged role tracking.Create a change control processfor all privilege escalations and role changes on user accounts.Enable alerts on privilege escalations and role changes.Log privileged user changesin the network environment, and create an alert for unusual events. REVIEW TRUST RELATIONSHIPS Review existing trust relationships with IT service providers,such as managed service providers (MSPs) and cloud service providers (CSPs). Threat actors are known to exploit trust relationships between providers and their customers to gain access to customer networks and data.Remove unnecessary trust relationships.Review contractual relationshipswith all service providers, and ensure contracts include:Security controls the customer deems appropriate.Appropriate monitoring and logging of provider-managed customer systems.Appropriate monitoring of the service provider’s presence, activities, and connections to the customer network.Notification of confirmed or suspected security events and incidents occurring on the provider’s infrastructure and administrative networks. Security controls the customer deems appropriate.Appropriate monitoring and logging of provider-managed customer systems.Appropriate monitoring of the service provider’s presence, activities, and connections to the customer network.Notification of confirmed or suspected security events and incidents occurring on the provider’s infrastructure and administrative networks. Note:review CISA’s page onAPTs Targeting IT Service Provider CustomersandCISA Insights: Mitigations and Hardening Guidance for MSPs and Small and Mid-sized Businessesfor additional recommendations for MSP and CSP customers. ENCOURAGE REMOTE WORK ENVIRONMENT BEST PRACTICES With the increase in remote work and use of VPN services due to COVID-19, the FBI, NSA, and CISA encourage regularly monitoring remote network traffic, along with employing the following best practices.Note:for additional information, see joint NSA-CISA Cybersecurity Information Sheet:Selecting and Hardening Remote Access VPN Solutions. Regularly update VPNs, network infrastructure devices, and devices used for remote work environmentswith the latest software patches and security configurations.When possible, require MFA on all VPN connections.Physical security tokens are the most secure form of MFA, followed by authenticator applications. When MFA is unavailable, mandate that employees engaging in remote work use strong passwords.Monitor network traffic for unapproved and unexpected protocols.Reduce potential attack surfaces by discontinuing unused VPN serversthat may be used as a point of entry by adversaries. ESTABLISH USER AWARENESS BEST PRACTICES Cyber actors frequently use unsophisticated methods to gain initial access, which can often be mitigated by stronger employee awareness of indicators of malicious activity. The FBI, NSA, and CISA recommend the following best practices to improve employee operational security when conducting business: Provide end user awareness and training.To help prevent targeted social engineering and spearphishing scams, ensure that employees and stakeholders are aware of potential cyber threats and how they are delivered. Also, provide users with training on information security principles and techniques.Inform employees of the risks of social engineering attacks,e.g., risks associated with posting detailed career information to social or professional networking sites.Ensure that employees are aware of what to do and whom to contact when they see suspicious activity or suspect a cyber intrusionto help quickly and efficiently identify threats and employ mitigation strategies. APPLY ADDITIONAL BEST PRACTICE MITIGATIONS Deny atypical inbound activity from known anonymization services,including commercial VPN services and The Onion Router (TOR).Impose listing policies for applications and remote accessthat only allow systems to execute known and permitted programs under an established security policy.Identify and create offline backups for critical assets.Implement network segmentation.Review CISA AlertAA20-120A: Microsoft Office 365 Security Recommendationsfor additional recommendations on hardening M365 cloud environments."
https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-040a,"Mitigations Cybersecurity authorities in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents: Keep all operating systems and software up to date.Timely patching is one of the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity threats. Regularly check for software updates and end of life (EOL) notifications, and prioritize patchingknown exploited vulnerabilities. In cloud environments, ensure that virtual machines, serverless applications, and third-party libraries are also patched regularly, as doing so is usually the customer’s responsibility. Automate software security scanning and testing when possible. Consider upgrading hardware and software, as necessary, to take advantage of vendor-provided virtualization and security capabilities.If you use RDP or other potentially risky services, secure and monitor them closely.Limit access to resources over internal networks, especially by restricting RDP and using virtual desktop infrastructure. After assessing risks, if RDP is deemed operationally necessary, restrict the originating sources and require MFA to mitigate credential theft and reuse. If RDP must be available externally, use a virtual private network (VPN), virtual desktop infrastructure, or other means to authenticate and secure the connection before allowing RDP to connect to internal devices. Monitor remote access/RDP logs, enforce account lockouts after a specified number of attempts to block brute force campaigns, log RDP login attempts, and disable unused remote access/RDP ports.Ensure devices are properly configured and that security features are enabled. Disable ports and protocols that are not being used for a business purpose (e.g., RDP Transmission Control Protocol Port 3389).Restrict Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol within the network to only access servers that are necessary, and remove or disable outdated versions of SMB (i.e., SMB version 1). Threat actors use SMB to propagate malware across organizations.Review the security posture of third-party vendors and those interconnected with your organization. Ensure all connections between third-party vendors and outside software or hardware are monitored and reviewed for suspicious activity.Implement listing policies for applications and remote access that only allow systems to execute known and permitted programs under an established.Open document readers in protected viewing modes to help prevent active content from running.Implement a user training program and phishing exercisesto raise awareness among users about the risks of visiting suspicious websites, clicking on suspicious links, and opening suspicious attachments. Reinforce the appropriate user response to phishing and spearphishing emails.Require MFAfor as many services as possible—particularly for webmail, VPNs, accounts that access critical systems, and privileged accounts that manage backups.Require all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and domain admin accounts) to havestrong, unique passwords. Passwords should not be reused across multiple accounts or stored on the system where an adversary may have access.Note: devices with local admin accounts should implement a password policy, possibly using a password management solution (e.g., Local Administrator Password Solution [LAPS]), that requires strong, unique passwords for each admin account.If using Linux, use a Linux security module (such as SELinux, AppArmor, or SecComp) for defense in depth.The security modules may prevent the operating system from making arbitrary connections, which is an effective mitigation strategy against ransomware, as well as against remote code execution (RCE).Protect cloud storage by backing up to multiple locations, requiring MFA for access, and encrypting data in the cloud.If using cloud-based key management for encryption, ensure that storage and key administration roles are separated. Limit access to resources over internal networks, especially by restricting RDP and using virtual desktop infrastructure. After assessing risks, if RDP is deemed operationally necessary, restrict the originating sources and require MFA to mitigate credential theft and reuse. If RDP must be available externally, use a virtual private network (VPN), virtual desktop infrastructure, or other means to authenticate and secure the connection before allowing RDP to connect to internal devices.

Malicious cyber actors use system and network discovery techniques for network and system visibility and mapping. To limit an adversary’s ability to learn an organization’s enterprise environment and to move laterally, take the following actions: Segment networks.Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement. Organizations with an international footprint should be aware that connectivity between their overseas arms can expand their threat surface; these organizations should implement network segmentation between international divisions where appropriate. For example, the ACSC has observed ransomware and data theft incidents in which Australian divisions of multinational companies were impacted by ransomware incidents affecting assets maintained and hosted by offshore divisions (outside their control).Implement end-to-end encryption.Deploying mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) can prevent eavesdropping on communications, which, in turn, can prevent cyber threat actors from gaining insights needed to advance a ransomware attack.Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated ransomware with a network-monitoring tool.To aid in detecting the ransomware, leverage a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement on a network. Endpoint detection and response tools are particularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into unusual network connections for each host. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are also able to detect and block many anomalous behaviors associated with early stages of ransomware deployment.Document external remote connections.Organizations should document approved solutions for remote management and maintenance. If an unapproved solution is installed on a workstation, the organization should investigate it immediately. These solutions have legitimate purposes, so they will not be flagged by antivirus vendors.Implement time-based access for privileged accounts.For example, the just-in-time access method provisions privileged access when needed and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the zero trust model) by setting network-wide policy to automatically disable admin accounts at the Active Directory level. As needed, individual users can submit requests through an automated process that enables access to a system for a set timeframe. In cloud environments, just-in-time elevation is also appropriate and may be implemented using per-session federated claims or privileged access management tools.Enforce principle of least privilege through authorization policies.Minimize unnecessary privileges for identities. Consider privileges assigned to human identities as well as non-person (e.g., software) identities. In cloud environments, non-person identities (service accounts or roles) with excessive privileges are a key vector for lateral movement and data access. Account privileges should be clearly defined, narrowly scoped, and regularly audited against usage patterns.Reduce credential exposure.Accounts and their credentials present on hosts can enable further compromise of a network. Enforcing credential protection—by restricting where accounts and credentials can be used and by using local device credential protection features—reduces opportunities for threat actors to collect credentials for lateral movement and privilege escalation.Disable unneeded command-line utilities; constrain scripting activities and permissions, and monitor their usage.Privilege escalation and lateral movement often depend on software utilities that run from the command line. If threat actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or moving laterally. Organizations should also disable macros sent from external sources via Group Policy.Maintain offline (i.e., physically disconnected) backups of data, and regularly test backup and restoration.These practices safeguard an organization’s continuity of operations or at least minimize potential downtime from an attack as well as protect against data losses. In cloud environments, consider leveraging native cloud service provider backup and restoration capabilities. To further secure cloud backups, consider separation of account roles to prevent an account that manages the backups from being used to deny or degrade the backups should the account become compromised.Ensure all backup data is encrypted,immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization’s data infrastructure. Consider storing encryption keys outside the cloud. Cloud backups that are encrypted using a cloud key management service (KMS) could be affected should the cloud environment become compromised.Collect telemetry from cloud environments.Ensure that telemetry from cloud environments—including network telemetry (e.g., virtual private cloud [VPC] flow logs), identity telemetry (e.g., account sign-on, token usage, federation configuration changes), and application telemetry (e.g., file downloads, cross-organization sharing)—is retained and visible to the security team. Note:critical infrastructure organizations with industrial control systems/operational technology networks should review joint CISA-FBI Cybersecurity AdvisoryDarkSide Ransomware: Best Practices for Preventing Business Disruption from Ransomware Attacksfor more recommendations, including mitigations to reduce the risk of severe business or functional degradation should their entity fall victim to ransomware."
