https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa18-337a,"Mitigations DHS and FBI recommend that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. System owners and administrators should review any configuration changes before implementation to avoid unwanted impacts. Audit your network for systems that use RDP for remote communication. Disable the service if unneeded or install available patches. Users may need to work with their technology venders to confirm that patches will not affect system processes.Verify that all cloud-based virtual machine instances with public IPs have no open RDP ports, especially port 3389, unless there is a valid business reason to keep open RDP ports. Place any system with an open RDP port behind a firewall and require users to use a virtual private network (VPN) to access that system.Enable strong passwords and account lockout policies to defend against brute force attacks.Where possible, apply two-factor authentication.Regularly apply system and software updates.Maintain a good back-up strategy.Enable logging and ensure that logging mechanisms capture RDP logins. Keep logs for a minimum of 90 days and review them regularly to detect intrusion attempts.When creating cloud-based virtual machines, adhere to the cloud provider’s best practices for remote access.Ensure that third parties that require RDP access follow internal policies on remote access.Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Where possible, disable RDP on critical devices.Regulate and limit external-to-internal RDP connections. When external access to internal resources is required, use secure methods such as VPNs. Of course, VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications.Scan for and remove suspicious email attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its ""true file type"" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).Disable file and printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication. Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in Special Publication 800-83,Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for Desktops and Laptops, from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.[1]"
https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa18-284a,"Mitigations There are several measures that will improve the overall cybersecurity of your organization and help protect it against the types of tools highlighted in this report. Network defenders are advised to seek further information using the links below. Protect your organization from malware.See NCCIC Guidance: https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST13-003.See UK NCSC Guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/protecting-your-organisation-malware.Board toolkit: five question for your board’s agenda.See UK NCSC Guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/board-toolkit-five-questions-your-boards-agenda.Use a strong password policy and multifactor authentication (also known as two-factor authentication or two-step authentication) to reduce the impact of password compromises.See NCCIC Guidance:https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST05-012.See UK NCSC Guidance:https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/multi-factor-authentication-online-servicesandhttps://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/setting-two-factor-authentication-2fa.Protect your devices and networks by keeping them up to date. Use the latest supported versions, apply security patches promptly, use antivirus and scan regularly to guard against known malware threats.See NCCIC Guidance:https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-006.See UK NCSC Guidance:https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/mitigating-malware.Prevent and detect lateral movement in your organization’s networks.See UK NCSC Guidance:https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/preventing-lateral-movement.Implement architectural controls for network segregation.See UK NCSC Guidance:https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/10-steps-network-security.Protect the management interfaces of your critical operational systems. In particular, use browse-down architecture to prevent attackers easily gaining privileged access to your most vital assets.See UK NCSC blog post:https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/protect-your-management-interfaces.Set up a security monitoring capability so you are collecting the data that will be needed to analyze network intrusions.See UK NCSC Guidance:https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/introduction-logging-security-purposes.Review and refresh your incident management processes.See UK NCSC Guidance:https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/10-steps-incident-management.Update your systems and software. Ensure your operating system and productivity applications are up to date. Users with Microsoft Office 365 licensing can use “click to run” to keep their office applications seamlessly updated.Use modern systems and software. These have better security built-in. If you cannot move off out-of-date platforms and applications straight away, there are short-term steps you can take to improve your position.See UK NCSC Guidance:https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/obsolete-platforms-security-guidance.Manage bulk personal datasets properly.See UK NCSC Guidance:https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/protecting-bulk-personal-data-introduction.Restrict intruders' ability to move freely around your systems and networks. Pay particular attention to potentially vulnerable entry points (e.g., third-party systems with onward access to your core network). During an incident, disable remote access from third-party systems until you are sure they are clean.See UK NCSC Guidance:https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/preventing-lateral-movementandhttps://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/assessing-supply-chain-security.Allow list applications. If supported by your operating environment, consider allow listing of permitted applications. This will help prevent malicious applications from running.See UK NCSC Guidance:https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/eud-security-guidance-windows-10-1709#applicationwhitelistingsection.Manage macros carefully. Disable Microsoft Office macros, except in the specific applications where they are required.Only enable macros for users that need them day-to-day and use a recent and fully patched version of Office and the underlying platform, ideally configured in line with the UK NCSC’s End User Device Security Collection Guidance and UK NCSC’s Macro Security for Microsoft Office Guidance:https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/end-user-device-securityandhttps://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/macro-security-microsoft-office.Use antivirus. Keep any antivirus software up to date, and consider use of a cloud-backed antivirus product that can benefit from the economies of scale this brings. Ensure that antivirus programs are also capable of scanning Microsoft Office macros.See NCCIC Guidance:https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-005.See UK NCSC Guidance:https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/macro-security-microsoft-office.Layer organization-wide phishing defenses. Detect and quarantine as many malicious email attachments and spam as possible, before they reach your end users. Multiple layers of defense will greatly cut the chances of a compromise.Treat people as your first line of defense. Tell personnel how to report suspected phishing emails, and ensure they feel confident to do so. Investigate their reports promptly and thoroughly. Never punish users for clicking phishing links or opening attachments.NCCIC encourages users and administrators to report phishing tophishing-report@us-cert.gov.See NCCIC Guidance:https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014.See UK NCSC Guidance:https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/phishing.Deploy a host-based intrusion detection system. A variety of products are available, free and paid-for, to suit different needs and budgets.Defend your systems and networks against denial-of-service attacks.See UK NCSC Guidance:https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/denial-service-dos-guidance-collection.Defend your organization from ransomware. Keep safe backups of important files, protect from malware, and do not pay the ransom– it may not get your data back.See NCCIC Guidance:https://www.us-cert.gov/Ransomware.See UK NCSC Guidance:https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/mitigating-malwareandhttps://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/backing-your-data.Make sure you are handling personal data appropriately and securely.See NCCIC Guidance: https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-013.See UK NCSC Guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/gdpr-security-outcomes.
