https://certvde.com/de/advisories/VDE-2020-037/,"TwinCAT XAR with default installation path, = 3.1 Mitigation Please consider the solution described with the next section (title “Solution”) for new installations only and installations for which it is acceptable to reinstall TwinCAT. For existing installations a script is provided for download at the following link: https://download.beckhoff.com/download/Document/product-security/Advisories/advisory-2020-003/cve-2020-12510.zip It changes the permissions of a directory of an already installed TwinCAT 3.1 installation. More precisely, it reads the current permissions of “C:\Program Files” and copies them to the directory “3.1\System” underneath the installation path of TwinCAT (default “C:\TwinCAT\3.1\System”). The procedure to use that script is as follows: Download the script, unzip it, and copy it to the IPC. On the IPC log in as administrator and open a PowerShell (Windows-Key + R + “PowerShell”). At the PowerShell enter the following command to temporarily allow the execution of scripts: set-executionpolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process (The effect of this is limited to the life-time of the current shell window because of “-Scope Process”.) Then change to the path to where you downloaded the script and execute it: .\cve-2020-12510.ps1 The expected output is “Copied the permissions from C:\Program Files to \3.1\System”. Close the PowerShell and log out from the IPC as needed. It is safe to apply the script several times. It is safe to run it during full operation of TwinCAT XAR 3.1. There is no need to reboot the IPC afterwards. There is no need to periodically run the script. Future updates of TwinCAT 3.1 will either not touch the permissions which are set by the script or apply more appropriate ones. To apply the procedure to a set of IPCs you can prepare a USB stick with the content of the ZIP file “cve-2020- 12510.zip” (see download URL above). Then the procedure for each IPC is: Log in as administrator on the IPC. Open the USB stick with the File Explorer (formerly known as Windows Explorer). Double click on the file “run-cve-2020-12510.bat”. (This simply invokes the PowerShell to execute the script already described above.) Solution Please consider the mitigation described with the section above for existing installations for operation. Please consider to choose “C:\Program Files\TwinCAT” during installation of TwinCAT 3.1. If you have installed it already then please uninstall and re-install it with the changed path. Please use the custom installation for this. That will automatically protect the binaries such that they can only be modified by an administrator. Please mind that already installed projects underneath C:\TwinCAT need to be moved. It is recommended to perform a backup of the complete device before such action. For security reasons, please remove the former content of C:\TwinCAT at the end of this sequence. This will also prevent confusion. Update A (25.11.2020): Split into Mitigation and Solution"

Remark: One Measure should be to block port 4840 via the external firewall and open this port for authenticated access only. • Use Virtual Private Networks (VPN) tunnels when remote access is required. • Use IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems) where possible to detect anomalies in the network. • Activate and use user administration and password functions. • Use encrypted communication links. • Restrict access to both the development tools and their projects and the products of the automation system by physical means, operating system functions, etc. • Protect the development tool by using the latest virus detection solutions. • Use of certificate-based communication via the message security modes Sign or Sign&Encrypt and trust of the corresponding client certificates on the machine controller by the OPC-UA server.

Additionally, please refer to the following Recommendations Users running communication over an untrusted network who require full protection should switch to an alternative solution such as running the communication over a VPN. Festo strongly recommends to minimize and protect network access to connected devices with state of the art techniques and processes. For a secure operation follow the recommendations in the product manuals and note the protocols and their supported features in Festo Field Device Tool or Festo Automation Suite online help. As part of a security strategy, Festo recommends the following general defense measures to reduce the risk of exploits: - Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that they are not accessible from outside - Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks - Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required - Activate and apply user management and password features - Use encrypted communication links - Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc. - Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions"

General recommendations Users running communication over an untrusted network who require full protection should switch to an alternative solution such as running the communication over a VPN. Festo strongly recommends to minimize and protect network access to connected devices with state of the art techniques and processes. As part of a security strategy, Festo recommends the following general defense measures to reduce the risk of exploits: Use devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that they are not accessible from outside Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks - Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required Activate and apply user management and password features Use encrypted communication links Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc. Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions"

Use general security best practices to protect systems from local and network attacks like described in the application node AH EN INDUSTRIAL SECURITY . 2. Run CodeMeter as client only and use localhost as binding for the CodeMeter communication. With binding to localhost an attack is no longer possible via remote network connection. The network server is disabled by default. If it is not possible to disable the network server, using a host-based firewall to restrict access to the network for reducing the risk is strongly recommended. 3. The CmWAN server is disabled by default. Please check if CmWAN is enabled and disable the feature if it is not needed. 4. Run the CmWAN server only behind a reverse proxy with user authentication to prevent attacks from unauthenticated users. The risk of an unauthenticated attacker can be further reduced by using a host-based firewall that only allows the reverse proxy to access the CmWAN port. Remediation PHOENIX CONTACT strongly recommends affected users to upgrade to CodeMeter V7.60c, which fixes these vulnerabilities. WIBU-SYSTEMS has already published this update for CodeMeter on their homepage. Since this current version of CodeMeter V7.60c has not yet been incorporated into Phoenix Contact products, we strongly recommend to download and install the current CodeMeter version directly from the WIBU-SYSTEMS homepage. Install Phoenix Contact Activation Wizard from version 1.7 when available. Please check the Phoenix Contact e-Shop for your related Software product regularly."
